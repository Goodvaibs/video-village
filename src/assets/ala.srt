1
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,208
Valmiki! Is your wife here?

2
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,291
Yes...

3
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,583
Where is Mr. Ramachandra’s wife?

4
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,333
She’s here.

5
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,791
It’s a baby boy.

6
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:49,958
That’s great news.

7
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,708
I don’t have change… I can’t
afford to tip you a note.

8
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,166
Thank God.

9
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,666
Sister, clean the baby
and put her to bed.

10
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,416
We must inform
Mr. Ramachandra about this.

11
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,458
Note down the exact time.

12
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:49,791
I don’t want the
horoscope to be messed up.

13
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:50,708
It’s 12...

14
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,583
Sir, I need the phone.

15
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:53,916
Can’t you see that
I’m talking here?

16
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,083
It’s an emergency, sir.

17
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,166
Mr. Ramachandra’s baby boy…

18
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,083
So what?

19
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,708
He was stable when the
doctor saw him last.

20
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,333
But he’s not moving now.

21
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,125
Ma’am is under sedation.

22
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,041
I’ll call you back.

23
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,750
Doctor informed the family
that it’s a baby boy.

24
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,458
I’m worried.

25
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:12,833
They are influential people.

26
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:16,000
I’m afraid they
will pin this on me.

27
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,666
Fine.

28
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,125
I’m blessed with a boy.

29
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,625
Let’s switch Mr. Ramachandra’s
son with mine.

30
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm working in their company.

31
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,125
It’s their generosity
that I lead a decent life.

32
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,666
This is the least
I can do for them.

33
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,666
I’ll give them my baby boy.

34
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,083
How will you explain
this to your wife?

35
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,625
Only my family will
prosper if he is with us.

36
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,833
But a whole community will
prosper if he is with them.

37
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,083
I will sacrifice my child.

38
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,875
By God’s grace, hopefully I’ll
have another kid in a year or so.

39
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,916
Sir, listen to me.

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,458
Don’t say a word…
just come with me.

41
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,583
Come on.

42
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,583
Pick him up.

43
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,000
Pick him up.

44
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,000
We are switching dead
baby with a baby.

45
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,291
What’s wrong? Pick him up.

46
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,458
Make it fast.

47
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,666
Let’s get out, come on.

48
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,416
Let’s go!

49
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,708
Look.

50
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,125
He's alive.

51
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,333
Give the baby to me.

52
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,916
-Give him to me!
-Sir, no!

53
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:46,416
Shut up!

54
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,458
No, sir.

55
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,458
You did sacrifice your kid.

56
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,583
But now you are betraying them.

57
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:52,916
Betrayal?

58
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,250
Ramachandra and I joined this
company at the same time.

59
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,208
We’d go to the office
together on my scooter.

60
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,375
He got lucky and married ARK’s
daughter and drives a car now.

61
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,416
What about me?

62
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,125
And I’m still driving
the same old scooter.

63
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:05,750
He just got lucky.

64
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,125
This baby though...

65
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,250
he could’ve cried when we
switched him with my son.

66
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,250
He started crying when
we got downstairs. Why?

67
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,541
He is unlucky.

68
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,500
My son is destined to
lead a superior life...

69
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,291
while his son leads
an ordinary life.

70
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,916
It’s God’s play...
there’s nothing I can do about it.

71
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,708
-Go away!
-No, sir. Don’t do it.

72
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,916
This is not betrayal...
it’s a sin.

73
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,583
You had an evil plan in mind.

74
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,875
-I can’t let you do this.
-Shut up!

75
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,958
-Don't separate the baby from his mother.
-I said shut up!

76
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,375
I won’t let you do this.
Give the baby to me.

77
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,708
I said let go!
Don’t make a scene now.

78
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,750
It’s over!
Forget it and go away.

79
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,333
-Give the baby back to me.
-I said go away!

80
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,625
Hey, Valmiki!

81
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,500
It's a baby boy.

82
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,291
How about you?
Baby boy or baby girl?

83
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:00,958
Baby boy!

84
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,250
What’s wrong?

85
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,375
Nothing. I got a cramp.

86
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,500
You got lucky, man.

87
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,041
What’s his name?

88
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,541
Raj Infra!

89
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,875
Amazing!

90
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,708
Did you like it?

91
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,291
It’s a royal name, sir.

92
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,208
The name a King deserves.

93
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,291
This is all good.

94
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,041
But have you thought of
any names for your son?

95
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,041
Yes.

96
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,041
Tell me.

97
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,375
Is that a name?

98
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,500
Is this "the" name?

99
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,416
Yeah!

100
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,583
What kind of name is this?

101
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,250
I’ve performed several ceremonies.

102
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,875
But I will never
approve of such a name.

103
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,000
I’ll be putting my image
at stake with this name.

104
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,375
-Priest...
-What?

105
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,750
How can you call your son "Bantu"?
It’s disgusting!

106
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,125
Right!

107
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,625
Why? Lord Hanuman is
called "Rama Bantu."

108
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,333
He’s still worshipped.

109
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,958
Lord Hanuman and Lord
Rama are an exception.

110
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,916
Whose servant is
your son going to be?

111
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,250
What is this?

112
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,625
You scored nine in Math?

113
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,500
It’s okay if your teacher didn’t give
you a higher score. We’ll add it.

114
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,708
Seven...

115
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,708
-What are you doing, Valmiki?
-Ma’am...

116
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,791
Raj’s progress report.

117
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,375
Oh. His score in Math?

118
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,833
97.

119
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,666
Dear! He scored 98 in Math.

120
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,458
Why did you leave
those two marks?

121
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,875
You should’ve scored a 100.

122
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,458
How can you say that, dear?
He got such a good score.

123
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,500
His score won’t change anything.

124
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,875
Few people are born that way.
Very bad!

125
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,583
Hey, stop it!

126
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,541
Hold it properly.

127
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,833
Thank God! He’s here and
my son is in the palace.

128
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,041
He’s happy even while sleeping.

129
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:39,416
Even though you lost everything,
How do you manage to stay happy?

130
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,291
Hey!

131
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,958
Grandma has sent some pickle.
You need to go get it.

132
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,041
Go to the bus stand.

133
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,541
Do I have an option?

134
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,458
Here you go, dear.
Coconut and camphor.

135
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,041
-Where’s the pumpkin?
-We don’t have it.

136
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,791
-Did you add it to the lentil soup?
-I did, sir.

137
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,250
He is coming home from
America after two years.

138
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,916
We need pumpkin
to ward off evil.

139
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:13,958
Damn it!

140
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,250
He isn’t coming home
after a great achievement.

141
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,125
He dropped out in the
final semester of MBA.

142
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,458
Please calm down, sir.

143
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,250
Really?

144
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,625
-Hey! Are you at the bus stand?
-Yes.

145
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,583
Yes, you told me
to collect pickles.

146
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,500
Dump them, buy a pumpkin and
come to Mr. ARK’s residence.

147
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,583
Pumpkin?

148
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,583
Yes! Pumpkin!

149
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,541
How will I get a pumpkin here?

150
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,625
-Pumpkin?
-Don’t be late. It’s urgent.

151
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,083
Autorickshaw!

152
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,416
Wait here.

153
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,416
Hey! Hey! Where are you rushing?

154
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,416
You can’t carry it.

155
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,708
I’m carrying your burden.
This is nothing.

156
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:09,625
Give it to me.

157
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,625
I’ve been noticing it
since I was a kid.

158
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,500
You never let me cross the gate.
What’s your problem?

159
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,541
It’s <i>Vaikunthapuram</i>, son.

160
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,875
No entry for losers like you.

161
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,500
Few lives don’t get any better.

162
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,333
Go back home.

163
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,083
Raj is here! Raj is here!

164
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,666
He has affection towards
everyone except me.

165
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,750
Sir, should I drop
the luggage inside?

166
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,291
Why would I hire an auto,
if I had such a big house.

167
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,375
Let's go...

168
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,000
let’s drive through the
bumpy lanes of Ameerpet.

169
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:42,833
That’s our range.

170
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,416
Have you been drinking
a lot in America?

171
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,625
You are shining.

172
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,958
Well, he’s back.

173
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,958
You both can drink together now.

174
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,333
What did you get me?

175
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,125
He’s already feeling low, Dad.

176
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,000
Don’t hurt him more, please!

177
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,583
But we are hurt, not him.

178
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,666
Dad, I have to do some shopping.

179
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,541
Take me with you
while going to office.

180
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,541
I’m busy… he will take you.

181
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:31,500
What is she saying?

182
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,791
She says he’s got an interview.

183
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,000
It’s eight o'clock now.

184
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,458
His interview is at ten.

185
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:41,041
Ask him to take her along
and buy medicines for his mom.

186
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,875
And then attend the interview.

187
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,333
He has plenty of time on his hands.

188
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,916
Not again.
What is she saying now?

189
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,750
How can he manage in
such a short span of time?

190
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,000
Like I manage this
family with my salary.

191
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,458
Ask him to do the same.

192
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,208
-Hey!
-Yes.

193
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,041
We are from a middle-class family.

194
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,291
We have tons of
things to worry about.

195
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,041
-We have to move on.
-Okay.

196
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,541
SIRI LADIES' TAILOR.

197
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,083
Brother!

198
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,083
Brother.

199
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,083
Buy medicines for mom.
I’m running late for my interview.

200
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,708
-They snatched my scarf?
-I know, right?

201
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,458
If girls like the color,
they will snatch it.

202
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,208
What will men do with a scarf?

203
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,500
They must be out of their minds.

204
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,375
Buy chocolates with the change.

205
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:43,375
Usually, brothers get very angry and fight
when men misbehave with their sisters.

206
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:49,541
You have way too many
expectations from me, sweetheart.

207
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:50,875
I’m late for my interview.

208
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,083
Would you react like this,
if it were your girlfriend?

209
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:56,750
No.

210
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,041
Get lost!

211
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,791
Damn! That was provoking.

212
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,791
I feel like doing something now.

213
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:10,000
Brother, did you see a gang pass
by with a scarf in their hands?

214
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,750
The guys on the red bike?

215
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,666
Don't try to act smart with me.

216
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,166
Where did they go?

217
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,666
Brother...

218
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,708
That scarf...
belongs to my sister.

219
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,833
Your sister looks smoking hot, man.

220
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,625
Can I get the scarf back?

221
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,875
Get your sister here in
exchange for the scarf.

222
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:26,583
Scarf...

223
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,375
Give me the scarf!

224
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,500
When he said my sister looks
hot, I didn’t feel bad.

225
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,500
She’s a beautiful girl.

226
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,916
I was happy that she’d save
some money on the dowry.

227
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,125
That’s how we think.

228
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,083
But that guy intervened
like some villain.

229
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,166
And said sister in exchange for the scarf.
How could he say that?

230
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,166
No, listen...

231
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,208
he ripped my heart apart.

232
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,041
Looking up and to the sides
when I’m sad is my mannerism.

233
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,791
But you don’t have the basic sense of
thinking twice before hitting someone.

234
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,000
-Hey, sis.
-Sorry brother… I got angry.

235
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,916
That’s fine.
I got your scarf back.

236
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,708
-They gave it back?
-Yes, they cleaned it as well.

237
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,291
Awesome!

238
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,333
That move?

239
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,458
Stylish, right?

240
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,291
I like it as well.

241
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,583
I don’t know… it
just worked out.

242
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,541
Why do you want to join
our tourism company?

243
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:52,500
With the help of your company
I can visit countries.

244
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:53,916
He's energetic.

245
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,083
Give me your file.

246
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,583
I deal with sales
in this company.

247
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,583
But the HR met with
a small accident.

248
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,875
He’ll be joining us later.

249
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,083
So, let’s proceed.

250
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,458
Hey! I like your sense of
humor, man.

251
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,083
Okay, let's read some more.

252
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,708
People usually visit
Bangkok or buy the Bentley car.

253
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,916
But you have written,
"I want to buy a bike."

254
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,750
-Have you got time to spare, sir?
-Lots of it.

255
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:22,750
-Dear...
-Yes.

256
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,333
His college is starting tomorrow.
Did you bring him any new clothes?

257
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:26,750
Of course, I did.

258
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:31,000
I said Mr. Ramachandra’s son
that Bantu was starting college.

259
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,833
He gave me all his old
clothes right away.

260
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,000
That’s not it...
I was looking at the perfume in his hand.

261
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,500
Was he gracious enough to
give his perfume as well?

262
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,625
Ae you kidding me?

263
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,583
Do you want it or not?

264
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,375
Do you have something to say?

265
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,500
I was forced to.

266
00:20:56,916 --> 00:21:00,458
You’re always so blunt
and honest, right?

267
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,875
I get a headache whenever I lie.

268
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,291
And when I started speaking the truth… the
other person started having a headache.

269
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,583
I feel so relaxed now, sir.

270
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,500
So, you must’ve started telling the
truth about the little things first.

271
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,791
Not at all, sir.
I had gone straight for the big fish.

272
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,416
Hey! I guess it’s the loan shark.
Tell him I’m not home.

273
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,375
Hey... is your father's home?

274
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:24,666
Father...

275
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,333
He asked me to tell
you he isn’t home.

276
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,166
So shameless!

277
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,333
How could you make
your kid lie for you?

278
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,583
You’ve already lost
one of your legs.

279
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,166
Betray a good man like me
and you’ll lose the other one as well.

280
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:42,708
Whatever.

281
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,333
That leg is going to hurt badly.

282
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,083
What did you just tell him?

283
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,416
Better, you should’ve
led him to me directly.

284
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,125
You’re just supposed to say,
"Dad’s not home." That’s it!

285
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,250
Hey, can I see your dad?

286
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,083
He’s not home...

287
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,791
Why do we care if he’s behind
the wall or under the table?

288
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,750
He’s not home and that’s final.

289
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,125
Your wife is not home, right?

290
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,125
Shameless fellow.

291
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,375
Hey!

292
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,250
We are a middle-class family.

293
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,875
How will you deal with life
if you can’t lie?

294
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,791
Hey, you’re always busy cooking.
Get some sense into him.

295
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:34,875
Besides,
you’re not Ramachandra’s son.

296
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:37,625
You can’t afford to speak the truth
always. Moreover, aren’t you afraid?

297
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,833
If I tell the truth,
I’ll be afraid only for that moment.

298
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,875
But if I lie,
I’ll be afraid all the time.

299
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:47,708
That was a great punch!
You rocked!

300
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,916
A mother is in pain only
when she’s giving birth.

301
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,541
But a father’s in pain
throughout the kid’s life.

302
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:56,000
Hey! Why are you not clapping?

303
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,708
He has fans and they
clapped for him.

304
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:58,833
You have none and
so you get nothing.

305
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,041
Sit down and eat.

306
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,875
-You got a seat in MBA.
-It was a prestigious college, sir.

307
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:04,250
Why did you give it up?

308
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,708
Hey! The job is done.

309
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,541
I sorted everything out.

310
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:09,833
Sort?

311
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:13,416
How could you cancel his
scholarship to get her a seat?

312
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,083
He’s a man.

313
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:17,083
He’ll figure something out.

314
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,125
What are you looking at?

315
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:24,541
Son...

316
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:26,000
Shall I tell you something?

317
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,666
You might have scored 90+ runs.

318
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,500
But your number of centuries
still stands at zero.

319
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:32,791
That explains your
life to the dot.

320
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,833
You almost get what you want
but never quite have it.

321
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,041
Like I told you,
few lives don’t get any better.

322
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:47,000
This tragedy calls for
more than a century, Bantu.

323
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,375
Shall we try something musical?
Something light-hearted.

324
00:23:56,458 --> 00:24:01,083
Hey! Give the table lamp and desk
to your sister. She has to study.

325
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,791
My son is always a King.

326
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,083
<i>I can’t begin to tell you my story</i>
<i>My pain has no ending</i>

327
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,625
<i>Why are these dads torturing us?</i>

328
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,125
<i>They don’t listen to us or understand us</i>

329
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,875
<i>When I think of dad</i>
<i>It gives me chills all over</i>

330
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,375
<i>I ask for 100 bucks and</i>
<i>He reminds me we’re not rich</i>

331
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,333
<i>I cry to myself thinking</i>
<i>He’s out of his mind</i>

332
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,041
<i>It’s the same scene in every household.</i>
<i>What do you say, bro?</i>

333
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:23,250
<i>My name is Bantu</i>
<i>And I hate my name</i>

334
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:28,250
<i>I fight with my cunning dad</i>
<i>Day and night</i>

335
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,375
<i>My mother’s husband...</i>

336
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:38,708
<i>Turned out to be my dad</i>

337
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,375
<i>You can’t lock rain in a bottle</i>

338
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,875
<i>You can’t capture joy in a snap</i>

339
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:48,083
<i>There are no shortcuts to freedom</i>

340
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:50,750
<i>You can deny me or</i>
<i>Join hands with me</i>

341
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:53,291
<i>You can’t fit the woods in your backyard</i>

342
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:55,833
<i>You can’t make a pigeon your paperweight</i>

343
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,291
<i>You can’t start a bonfire using a volcano</i>

344
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,875
<i>I’m a blank cheque that’s not cashed</i>

345
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:35,791
<i>Being the son of Valmiki means</i>
<i>Being the epitome of problems</i>

346
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,875
<i>Only Thanos can make people</i>
<i>Smile with a snap</i>

347
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:46,083
<i>My mother’s husband...</i>

348
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:51,125
<i>He’s one big dummy</i>

349
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,166
He wants a new bike.

350
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:36,708
He can use my scooter.

351
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,041
That’s enough, son.

352
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:47,583
He gets emotional
for small things.

353
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,125
Enough… let me go.

354
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:52,500
No, you are safe here.

355
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:54,541
I might hit you,
if you are far from me.

356
00:27:57,541 --> 00:28:01,833
Bantu, after listening to your
story, I feel like killing your dad.

357
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
But it’s a huge risk.

358
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,333
It also makes me want to
adopt you and send you abroad.

359
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:07,416
But it’s a costly affair.

360
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:09,416
Because I can’t do either of it.

361
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:11,458
Let me offer you this job.

362
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,208
Come on, dear. Sign here.

363
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:18,291
This should end
all your miseries.

364
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,208
Sekhar is here.

365
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:21,458
Great timing!

366
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:24,166
He’s our HR. Meet him and
make a good first impression.

367
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:25,708
I’ll impress him, sir.

368
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,416
What happened?

369
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,916
I was happy you got the job.
but I’m shocked you hit the HR.

370
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:44,166
This is the time to put your character,
integrity and individuality aside...

371
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:45,458
and say sorry.

372
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:47,125
Mr. Reddy...

373
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:50,750
-Hey! What are you doing here?
-Get out!

374
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:52,208
I’m begging you.

375
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:54,916
Please, sir... I’m begging you.

376
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,458
I really need this
job sir… come on.

377
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,041
I’ll give you the job... I feel like
I’m going to puke. Stop it right now.

378
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:01,750
You will stand by your
word, right?

379
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:03,416
Yes, let go of me!

380
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Sign here… right here.

381
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,333
Right here, sir.
That's it!

382
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:15,916
Hey, he signed it! But how?

383
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:17,708
I touched his feet
like you said.

384
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:19,666
-What did he do?
-He signed my papers.

385
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:21,375
I will catch him.

386
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:22,750
Go downstairs.
I’ll come join you.

387
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:28,458
Did he hit you hard?

388
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,583
He hit me with a
scarf but it was...

389
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:32,458
I won’t say the word.
But he broke my heart, Reddy.

390
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:34,291
No matter what you say,
I believe he has no ego.

391
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:36,458
-That is why he touched your feet.
-What about me?

392
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:37,375
You have no common sense.

393
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:38,666
That is why you snatched
his sister’s scarf.

394
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,041
I didn’t snatch it, Reddy.
It got stuck on my hand.

395
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:43,125
I didn’t mean to do it.
It was an accident.

396
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:44,083
You could’ve returned the scarf.

397
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:46,541
-I didn’t want to create a scene.
-Well, you already did.

398
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,125
-Why is the production on hold?
-No stock, sir.

399
00:29:55,916 --> 00:29:56,833
Then order it.

400
00:29:56,916 --> 00:29:59,166
The distribution has been halted
because we didn’t pay the bills, sir.

401
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,250
Call the bank and clear the due.

402
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:03,750
The OD is already too high.

403
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,041
I will take care of it.

404
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:31,291
-Which floor?
-Where are you going?

405
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:33,125
-Ninth floor.
-Me too.

406
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:37,583
Yeah. Yeah.

407
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,750
I’ve never seen you around.

408
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:41,041
I joined yesterday.

409
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:43,500
-Yesterday?
-Yes. Yesterday.

410
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:46,791
Have you met your boss?

411
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:48,166
He didn’t come to
office yesterday.

412
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,041
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.

413
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,208
This looks good as well.

414
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,625
I saw a girl in the
elevator earlier.

415
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:05,500
She blew my mind.

416
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:07,000
Is she the receptionist,
Mr. Reddy?

417
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,000
I’d be with her right now
if she was so beautiful.

418
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:10,916
Go and greet our boss first.

419
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:12,291
We can relax for the day.

420
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:14,208
Relax and chill!
I’ll impress her and be right back.

421
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,791
Now what did you do?

422
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:26,625
Hey! I thought you were just
in the elevator with ma’am.

423
00:32:26,708 --> 00:32:27,875
But you were trying
to get on her.

424
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:29,291
I won’t say the word.

425
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:30,583
You were trying to flirt with her, right?

426
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,083
What do we do, Mr. Reddy?

427
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:38,291
You had a problem
yesterday as well.

428
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:40,458
I gave you a solution
and it worked out.

429
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:42,000
You want me to touch her feet?

430
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,583
Any other alternatives?

431
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:50,500
He doesn’t just hold legs… he twists
them according to his convenience.

432
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:56,375
Come in.

433
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:59,083
You think the name Bantu is cute?
It’s disgusting, ma’am.

434
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:01,083
In the elevator earlier...

435
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:06,750
Hello...

436
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:08,125
Look up.

437
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,166
My eyes are up here.

438
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,333
It’s hard for me, ma’am.

439
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:12,458
You’re working under me.

440
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:15,541
And I’m happy about it, ma’am.

441
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,708
-Only the cabin has changed.
-I still have to touch people’s feet.

442
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,000
Telling the truth is my first
nature, ma’am.

443
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,500
Sadism is my mannerism, Bantu.

444
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:27,291
What?

445
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:44,000
Do people come here for a vacation?

446
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:47,416
Maybe they can eat
without cooking.

447
00:33:56,416 --> 00:33:57,500
Hey, listen.

448
00:33:57,916 --> 00:33:58,916
Hey.

449
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:02,083
Why don't you change the topic?
I'm bored.

450
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,333
What?
Why are you guys just leaving?

451
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:09,166
That’s the only thing
on your mind, right?

452
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:13,500
-Who’s this?
-It’s me, ma’am.

453
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:14,625
Who are you?

454
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:16,958
You got upset with me for staring
at your legs in the lift.

455
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:18,791
And so, you sent me to Kutch.
It’s me. Bantu.

456
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:21,250
I haven’t seen a fellow
human being in three days.

457
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:23,625
And this couple is lost in love.

458
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:25,083
Oh, my God!

459
00:34:25,666 --> 00:34:27,750
This guy is pulling
out the camping tents.

460
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:32,375
The temperature here is blazing, ma’am.
Please do something.

461
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,875
What?

462
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:35,666
Okay, I’ll do it.

463
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:47,833
Stop crushing her.

464
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:52,166
Hey, ma'am. Stop!

465
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:54,166
It’s very steep…
you will fall.

466
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:56,458
I’ll set up a rope and you
can grab it and go down.

467
00:34:58,791 --> 00:35:00,541
Don’t grab him. Grab the rope.

468
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:03,958
Wow! He is dancing so well.

469
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,333
Who is it?

470
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:19,416
It’s me, ma’am.

471
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:21,583
These people think I am dancing
but I am shivering.

472
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:23,583
They are uploading the
videos on the internet, ma’am.

473
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,916
Just give me a corner
seat in our office.

474
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,500
I’ll be at your feet.

475
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:30,916
I don't understand
your fantasy with legs.

476
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:34,208
I didn’t mean it like
that, ma’am.

477
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,458
I’m begging you.

478
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:55,416
Are you sleeping?

479
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:58,708
Good. Sleep.

480
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,750
I bought you 24 apples per
year, two per month.

481
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:06,333
So that makes 600 apples
in the last 25 years.

482
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:08,958
It's pointless.

483
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:12,541
You are not conscious.
You don’t eat.

484
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:14,333
I have diabetes... I can’t eat.

485
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,208
This leg keeps bothering me.

486
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:23,000
When we fought for the baby
in the hospital that day...

487
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:24,916
I had a cramp, remember?

488
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:29,375
It just got worse with
time and now I’m limping.

489
00:36:30,916 --> 00:36:34,000
You got lucky...
you are in coma for so long.

490
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,458
Because it happened on
the day my son was born.

491
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:40,958
Mr. Ramachandra is continuing
your treatment against all odds.

492
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:44,416
So, don’t feel guilty about it.

493
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:47,166
How long will you...

494
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,625
-Do you speak Telugu?
-What?

495
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:52,250
I mean to say... Malayalam.

496
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:54,041
How long will you
cling on to this body?

497
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:56,041
Just let go.

498
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:59,958
Take my advice and die in peace.

499
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,125
Did you check her
blood pressure?

500
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:34,958
Where is the nurse?
I want her reports.

501
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:37,666
Put the oxygen mask on.

502
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,166
Is she going to live?

503
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:42,875
Probably for two years
if she’s in coma.

504
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:45,125
She has two more months.

505
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:48,375
-Can she see?
-It’s complicated.

506
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,583
-Can she hear us?
-I’m not sure.

507
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:51,833
-Can she talk?
-Impossible!

508
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:52,958
Thank you.

509
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:57,125
You act cranky under the sun.

510
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,750
And you shiver in the snow.

511
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:03,208
You call me off the
hook and say "Ma’am..."

512
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,375
You’re good for nothing.

513
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:08,041
Few lives don’t get any
better, do they?

514
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:15,875
What?

515
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:17,541
Don’t belittle my life, ma’am.

516
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:20,750
I’ve heard enough from my dad.

517
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,708
I would get really
angry when he says it.

518
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,916
But now that you’re
also saying it...

519
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:27,458
I’m afraid it might be true.

520
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,333
Over all these years,

521
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,416
I’ve never had a single
phenomenal day in my life.

522
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:38,916
Is bad luck riding my
dad, me or my life?

523
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:41,291
I don't know.

524
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,375
Ma'am, this is a request.

525
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,541
Please wear pants
and longer skirts.

526
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:52,041
I can’t look away.

527
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:53,750
So beautiful, ma’am.

528
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,416
Get up.

529
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,541
When there’s weight on your
head, you won't look down.

530
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:08,375
-Ma’am?
-You can observe it, Bantu.

531
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:09,583
True.

532
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:12,375
You will know it very soon.

533
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:15,333
If you work hard,
you will succeed.

534
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:16,666
Go.

535
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:18,833
Work on the Paris tour.

536
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:31,500
Look.

537
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,083
She’s ma’am!

538
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,791
We know she’s our ma’am.
What's next?

539
00:39:39,291 --> 00:39:41,166
Ma’am was saying...

540
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:44,416
Sekhar, we have to handle
a few things with love.

541
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:45,375
Then do it.

542
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:47,041
-Dear...
-Yes, dear.

543
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:48,666
For the first time today...

544
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:52,250
I looked into her eyes
instead of staring at her legs.

545
00:39:58,541 --> 00:40:00,125
Ma’am, my foot!

546
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:02,833
Sekhar, handle with love.

547
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:04,208
He’s already in love with her.

548
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:22,500
<i>My eyes are hooked on to your legs</i>

549
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:26,833
<i>Don’t step on my gaze, show me some mercy</i>

550
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:48,583
<i>My eyes are hooked on to your legs</i>

551
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:53,000
<i>Don’t step on my gaze, show me some mercy</i>

552
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:57,375
<i>My dreams will guard your eyes like kohl</i>

553
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,625
<i>You set me on fire when</i>
<i>You rub your rosy cheeks</i>

554
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:06,041
<i>Your tresses fly as my breath</i>
<i>Whistles in the air</i>

555
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:10,541
<i>Don’t get all cranky</i>
<i>And push me away</i>

556
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:23,708
<i>Sweetheart!</i>
<i>I can’t help but fall for you</i>

557
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:28,000
<i>You know how the heart</i>
<i>Sways to the youth’s beat</i>

558
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:32,416
<i>Sweetheart!</i>
<i>I can’t help but fall for you</i>

559
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:36,541
<i>You know how the heart</i>
<i>Sways to the youth’s beat</i>

560
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:40,916
<i>My eyes are hooked on to your legs</i>

561
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:45,291
<i>Don’t step on my gaze, show me some mercy</i>

562
00:42:19,958 --> 00:42:23,958
<i>You’re like the cool breeze</i>
<i>Spilling fragrances of jasmine</i>

563
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:28,625
<i>You’re like the land</i>
<i>Shimmering with moonlight</i>

564
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:32,875
<i>You’re like a peacock dancing</i>
<i>In a garden of flowers</i>

565
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,500
<i>I can’t begin to describe</i>
<i>Your elegance in words</i>

566
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:42,250
<i>I caress you like the</i>
<i>Shadow that chases you</i>

567
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:46,208
<i>Yet, you don’t react the slightest, girl</i>

568
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:50,958
<i>I realize you’re not the girl</i>
<i>Who falls for trickery</i>

569
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:55,000
<i>Pay heed to this sweet plea</i>
<i>That makes my heart pound</i>

570
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:59,708
<i>Sweetheart!</i>
<i>I can’t help but fall for you</i>

571
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:03,916
<i>You know how the heart</i>
<i>Sways to the youth’s beat</i>

572
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:08,416
<i>Sweetheart!</i>
<i>I can’t help but fall for you</i>

573
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:12,791
<i>You know how the heart</i>
<i>Sways to the youth’s beat</i>

574
00:43:30,166 --> 00:43:34,416
<i>My eyes are hooked on to your legs</i>

575
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:38,666
<i>Don’t step on my gaze, show me some mercy</i>

576
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:43,166
<i>My dreams will guard your eyes like kohl</i>

577
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:47,708
<i>You set me on fire when</i>
<i>You rub your rosy cheeks</i>

578
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:55,083
There is a man
called Appal Naidu.

579
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:13,791
It might be taxes or fees.

580
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,791
You must ask with respect.

581
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:24,958
You are not meeting him.

582
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:27,666
You will meet his son.

583
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:36,500
They are planning to
expand their company.

584
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:40,750
Ramachandran...
the CEO of this company is getting old.

585
00:44:41,291 --> 00:44:43,000
His son Raj Manohar...

586
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:45,000
is very slow.

587
00:44:45,958 --> 00:44:49,291
They need money and I want
a part of his company.

588
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:58,166
His son wants our company.
So, his father is sending him.

589
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:01,750
Your father is sending you to stop him.

590
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:12,833
See...

591
00:45:13,125 --> 00:45:16,416
It's easy to say,
"No" to a waiter.

592
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:19,750
But it's difficult to reject
an influenced person.

593
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:23,250
So, when you reject
an influential person,

594
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,041
you will earn respect.

595
00:45:26,541 --> 00:45:29,375
Son, it's okay even if
you don't get power.

596
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:31,458
Be honest. That's enough.

597
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:32,916
This is the truth.

598
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:42,625
Bye, dear.

599
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,125
Hello...
I am almost there, ma'am.

600
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:09,750
Don't worry, your father is
in the hotel right behind us.

601
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:12,000
Is it the hotel behind us?

602
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:26,208
Your load is exported to Korea
from our port every month.

603
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:28,041
That port is not your
father's establishment.

604
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:29,750
Tell him it belongs
to the government.

605
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:35,791
But if we shut the gates,
your company will be in dire loss.

606
00:46:36,125 --> 00:46:38,958
There are many ports in this country.
Tell him, Raj.

607
00:46:39,916 --> 00:46:41,416
We will invest in your company.

608
00:46:42,458 --> 00:46:43,958
Welcome us with open arms.

609
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:46,083
We will be a part
of your company.

610
00:46:46,208 --> 00:46:47,583
Impossible!

611
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:49,375
Tell him, Raj.

612
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:04,250
The one in the grey coat?

613
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:11,083
We can cut down on the diesel cost,
if four people take the same car.

614
00:47:11,291 --> 00:47:13,083
Similarly, you can cut down on holiday
expenses,

615
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:14,541
if four families travel together.

616
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:15,708
It was her concept.

617
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,083
It's a great idea.

618
00:47:17,291 --> 00:47:18,875
I believed the same and
invested five crores.

619
00:47:19,125 --> 00:47:20,291
You’ve got a big heart.

620
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:22,125
She had a turnover of 50
crores in just two years.

621
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:23,416
She’s got a big brain.

622
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:24,875
I’m offering 100 crores.

623
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,375
I want the company.

624
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:27,750
That’s a huge amount.

625
00:47:35,791 --> 00:47:36,833
Why don't you talk?

626
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:40,916
Say yes, dear.

627
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,625
Say no.

628
00:47:44,791 --> 00:47:46,250
Just say no!

629
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:55,458
This isn’t a temple where
everyone is welcome.

630
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:59,916
Besides,
it's a loan when we ask for money.

631
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:02,541
When we don’t accept the offer.
It's a rejection.

632
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:16,083
Ma’am will not
sell her company...

633
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:18,208
Can you speak?

634
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:19,958
Sir, we floated the company

635
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:22,583
with affordable travel packages
for the middle-class.

636
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:27,166
If you buy the company with such a
huge amount, you’ll increase the rates.

637
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:30,041
It will increase
their travel fare.

638
00:48:32,916 --> 00:48:34,833
So what ma’am is
trying to say is...

639
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,833
This generation has lost
the courage to say "No."

640
00:48:45,666 --> 00:48:46,750
Hey, Das!

641
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:49,166
They can tussle with us and
still do business in the market?

642
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:52,375
She’s a girl after all.
We’ll crush you.

643
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:54,125
That’s a big warning.

644
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,375
Mr. Sudarshan...

645
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,916
I’m not so good
at this pep talk.

646
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:08,250
It will not match with
my personality either.

647
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:10,333
But the situation
is demanding it.

648
00:50:11,416 --> 00:50:13,291
Only two people have the
power to create something.

649
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,541
This planet and women.

650
00:50:15,916 --> 00:50:17,583
Why do you want
to mess with them?

651
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:19,458
We just have to surrender.

652
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,666
If you’re still not convinced,
I have three options.

653
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,291
First...
beat your men and control yourself.

654
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:34,375
Second, hit you and control you.

655
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:38,750
Third, predicting that I will
beat you and control yourself.

656
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,541
If you think controlling you is common
in all three options... you’re mistaken.

657
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,208
What’s common is I will
be smacking your men down.

658
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,000
For better or worse...

659
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:51,541
When someone says no to your
offer, it means...

660
00:50:55,541 --> 00:50:56,458
"No!"

661
00:50:59,416 --> 00:51:06,166
Most importantly,
when a woman says "No", it means...

662
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:09,333
It's a "No."

663
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:15,416
Ma’am, we can’t be here after
that speech I just gave.

664
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,750
Let’s get out of here when our
energy levels are high. Come on.

665
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:32,833
When I saw that guy
in the morning...

666
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:36,541
it felt like I was looking
at my own reflection.

667
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:43,583
But when I see my own son
on the computer screen...

668
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:47,625
He was struggling to say "no."

669
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:58,666
His weakness felt like my own.

670
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:00,375
Is this my failure?

671
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:04,625
Ramu, you were a clerk.

672
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,625
You had to impress
my dad to marry me.

673
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,333
You had to work hard for it.

674
00:52:10,916 --> 00:52:13,208
But my son has nothing to prove.

675
00:52:13,708 --> 00:52:15,041
He was born a Prince.

676
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:17,833
-Don’t compare him with others.
-I didn’t mean it, Yasu.

677
00:52:19,291 --> 00:52:21,708
I just meant that
guy spoke well.

678
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:26,041
Suppose we’re on our honeymoon.

679
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:29,916
How would you feel if I say
some guy hot in front of you?

680
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:36,250
That’s how I feel when you praise
someone else’s son in front of me.

681
00:52:42,875 --> 00:52:45,750
A mother's love is blind.

682
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:49,083
That guy caught your attention.

683
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,916
But for me, it was the girl.

684
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,666
She made a lot of progress with
the company in just three years.

685
00:52:55,166 --> 00:52:57,250
If she’s with us,
she can do wonders.

686
00:52:57,666 --> 00:53:00,041
How about we get your
son married to her?

687
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:03,541
She will bring the
perfect balance.

688
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:10,708
-Daddy...
-Yes, dear?

689
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:12,291
Why do I have to wear
a sari for dinner?

690
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:13,791
Because it’s a dinner
invite from Mr. ARK.

691
00:53:13,916 --> 00:53:16,708
I wouldn’t have cared
if it were someone else.

692
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:17,625
Don’t be so dumb.

693
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:19,875
The sari and the bouquet
are to impress them.

694
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,541
Otherwise, a box of
sweets would do it.

695
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:23,708
Let's go.

696
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:28,958
In case, they ask
if you can cook.

697
00:53:29,166 --> 00:53:31,291
Lie that you’re
almost good at it.

698
00:53:32,291 --> 00:53:34,583
Why would they ask
me if I could cook?

699
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:39,750
Is this an alliance?

700
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,416
Just a casual meeting, dear.

701
00:53:41,541 --> 00:53:44,041
Besides, even if they were proposing
marriage... it’s no big deal for them.

702
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,916
Dad!

703
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:47,083
Dear...

704
00:53:51,791 --> 00:53:52,791
What’s this?

705
00:53:53,083 --> 00:53:54,500
Give it to her if you like her.

706
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,708
Grandpa said it would
be a casual meeting.

707
00:53:59,958 --> 00:54:02,916
You should tell him you won’t meet anyone
else because there your angel is at home.

708
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:04,666
Hello. Why are you laughing?

709
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,750
Am I not your angel?

710
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:14,625
I’m Ramachandra.

711
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:15,666
I’m Anjaneya Prasad.

712
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:17,083
Even my name suggests
I’m at your service.

713
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:18,625
-Hey! No! No!
-Dad!

714
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:20,375
Dear, isn’t it true?

715
00:54:22,916 --> 00:54:25,291
This old man has a knack for
inviting embarrassing guests.

716
00:54:27,791 --> 00:54:29,166
Welcome.

717
00:54:32,291 --> 00:54:33,208
What would you like to have?

718
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:34,791
We’re blessed to be
sitting next to you.

719
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:36,041
What more could we ask for?

720
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:39,208
We’ll eat whatever you serve.
As long as it’s edible.

721
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:41,791
You have good sense of humor.

722
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:54,250
You guys aren’t talking much.

723
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:55,833
Because you are.

724
00:54:58,583 --> 00:55:00,208
My daughter is soft-spoken.

725
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:03,125
Yeah, right. She doesn’t even
bargain when she goes shopping.

726
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,750
Your son is soft-spoken as well.

727
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,708
He expressed it with a box.

728
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,333
My dear, you’re so lucky!

729
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:17,416
Fortune is calling.
My miserable days are over.

730
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:21,083
It feels like the Lords of
Wealth are paying me a visit.

731
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:22,416
What are you looking at? Get up!

732
00:55:22,625 --> 00:55:24,125
Give it a second thought.

733
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,833
This whole time,
you were worried about him being slow.

734
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,250
Now you’re worried
that he’s going fast.

735
00:55:32,958 --> 00:55:33,791
Dad!

736
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:37,375
What are you waiting for?
Let’s get them engaged.

737
00:55:43,208 --> 00:55:44,291
Why are you crying?

738
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,125
Tears of joy.

739
00:55:49,166 --> 00:55:50,333
What are you doing here?

740
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:53,375
Ma’am called me...
I thought she had some work...

741
00:55:55,958 --> 00:55:57,375
You don't have any work here.

742
00:55:57,875 --> 00:55:58,875
Go!

743
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:18,541
Well...

744
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:23,041
I bought that ring so that
he will marry my daughter.

745
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:24,958
He’s doing it.

746
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,916
You turned this lunch
into an engagement.

747
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,416
My daughter had a lot of
expectations on her wedding.

748
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,833
Then let’s make sure
we don’t fall short.

749
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:35,416
My daughter will commit
suicide if she can’t marry him.

750
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:37,791
She aspired to become a
collector when she was a kid.

751
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:38,916
Did that happen?

752
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:42,208
She will not do
everything she says.

753
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,208
Don’t worry.

754
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:45,208
Come on.

755
00:56:50,375 --> 00:56:51,250
This is all your fault.

756
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:52,708
What did I do?

757
00:56:53,958 --> 00:56:58,041
Because you hit Sudarshanam’s men
and Mr. Ramachandra noticed you.

758
00:56:58,625 --> 00:57:01,208
Because he noticed you,
he spoke to my father.

759
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:04,125
Because he spoke to my
father, I had to get engaged.

760
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:08,791
Did Sudarshanam get
scared and back off?

761
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:12,125
He called us to the police
station for a meeting.

762
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:14,166
-Don't worry, ma'am.
-Hey...

763
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:15,750
-Sit.
-But, ma'am.

764
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:18,166
No, you are angry.

765
00:57:22,416 --> 00:57:23,958
Is she your wife?

766
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:25,166
No way.

767
00:57:25,916 --> 00:57:26,875
She's my boss.

768
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:28,916
But her body language
says something else.

769
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,625
She’s scolding you with
so much confidence.

770
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,041
You can judge by body language?
My foot!

771
00:57:33,541 --> 00:57:34,958
She already got
engaged yesterday.

772
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:36,458
I don't think so.

773
00:57:36,541 --> 00:57:38,375
It'll work out soon.

774
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:39,666
What's going to happen?

775
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:41,375
You are not Ramachandra's son.

776
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,750
She's very practical.

777
00:57:42,958 --> 00:57:44,458
Reddy influenced him.

778
00:57:44,541 --> 00:57:46,375
Hey, stop it... stop it.

779
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:48,541
It will work out, trust me.

780
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:51,250
-What are you saying?
-Really?

781
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:08,000
-What's the issue?
-Sir, I gave her five crores.

782
00:58:08,416 --> 00:58:10,125
We asked for our money
and he got physical.

783
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:13,791
He didn't just ask for money.
He wants the whole company.

784
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,708
He was being insensitive to girls.

785
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:18,000
That is when I hit him, sir.

786
00:58:18,958 --> 00:58:20,958
-Did he cuss women?
-Yes, sir.

787
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:23,625
Then you have to
file a case on him.

788
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:28,041
Hey... call the writer.

789
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:31,333
He’s not some fighter that
you’d call the writer.

790
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:33,000
Look at him.

791
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:34,750
Look at my bodyguard.

792
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,541
-How can we believe this guy hit him?
-You have a point.

793
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,666
That’s a lie, sir. I hit him.

794
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:43,541
I’ll hit him again if I have to.

795
00:59:01,166 --> 00:59:03,250
-Can you notice any difference?
-What difference?

796
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:05,500
He was standing until now,
but now he is sitting there.

797
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,250
Maybe he is tired of
standing, so he sat down.

798
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:12,583
I hit him and he fell there.

799
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:13,625
Give me a break.

800
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:17,125
I hit him when you bent down.
He was in the air when you stood up.

801
00:59:17,208 --> 00:59:18,583
He was sitting by
the time you saw him.

802
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:20,666
Dear...

803
00:59:21,041 --> 00:59:23,291
Why don't you take
him to a good doctor?

804
00:59:39,708 --> 00:59:41,750
What’s wrong? What happened?

805
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,875
It's a stylish fight scene, sir.
Things like these don’t happen often.

806
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:47,166
All of you together
made it a big lie.

807
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:48,750
I'm hurt.

808
00:59:48,875 --> 00:59:50,083
You are hurt?

809
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:54,333
-What's your problem?
-I just hit him again, sir.

810
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,791
But I didn't see it.

811
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:57,875
-Call him back. I can hit him again.
-That's wrong.

812
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,875
You can’t say such things
to the police.

813
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:05,083
You don’t believe me when I say I hit him.
You don’t look when I hit him.

814
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:06,333
You don’t agree when
offer to hit him again.

815
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:07,250
You’re impossible, sir.

816
01:00:07,916 --> 01:00:09,000
Dear...

817
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:12,000
Why do you want
to get locked up?

818
01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:14,375
-You have a bright future.
-I know, sir.

819
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:17,750
Don't interrupt me while I talk!
I'll kill you!

820
01:00:18,041 --> 01:00:20,708
-Dear, what does he do for you?
-Annoy me.

821
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:22,791
So, nobody believes I hit him.

822
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:25,625
Hey! This is your final chance.

823
01:00:26,125 --> 01:00:27,166
I’ll ask her.

824
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:29,583
Whatever she says is final.

825
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:31,750
-You should stand by that.
-Yes.

826
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,291
Did he beat that guy?

827
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:40,458
Ma’am, you are also lying.

828
01:00:42,916 --> 01:00:44,708
Why are you so keen
on getting arrested?

829
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:46,541
But I had to tell the truth.

830
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,958
I don’t want the engagement.
Did I say it out?

831
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,416
-We can’t tell the truth all the time.
-Exactly.

832
01:00:51,791 --> 01:00:54,208
Nothing will go wrong if
you tell the truth, ma’am.

833
01:00:54,375 --> 01:00:56,125
You should do the
same with your dad.

834
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:58,333
I told him.
He said he’ll commit suicide.

835
01:00:58,541 --> 01:01:00,375
Then tell Raj’s father.

836
01:01:00,541 --> 01:01:02,125
Mr. Ramachandra?

837
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:05,041
Ma’am… listen to me, please.

838
01:01:05,416 --> 01:01:07,000
Try telling
Mr. Ramachandra once.

839
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,125
-Trust me and tell the truth.
-Okay, I will.

840
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:11,625
Give me that.

841
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:14,375
Telling the truth solves
all problems, ma’am.

842
01:01:14,541 --> 01:01:16,166
It really feels light.

843
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,625
Because I took the bag from you?

844
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:20,875
No, you idiot!

845
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:22,791
I meant I feel lighter.

846
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:24,041
I feel lighter!

847
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:27,208
Enough!

848
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:30,500
It’s obvious to be scared
when you hit someone suddenly.

849
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:32,666
He’s an idiot, man.
Why do you care if he’s scared?

850
01:01:32,791 --> 01:01:35,333
-I don’t mean him. I’m scared! Me!
-You’re scared. I get it.

851
01:01:35,416 --> 01:01:36,791
I have full clarity now.

852
01:01:39,916 --> 01:01:40,833
Are you hurt?

853
01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:44,041
Yes, but it feels good, ma’am.

854
01:01:46,041 --> 01:01:48,000
You are beating me.

855
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:49,916
Don’t call me ma’am.

856
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,666
It'll take time, ma'am.

857
01:01:54,708 --> 01:01:56,083
Call me Amulya.

858
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:58,458
I know your name, ma'am.

859
01:02:04,583 --> 01:02:06,000
It'll take time, ma'am.

860
01:02:06,416 --> 01:02:07,666
It'll take lot of time.

861
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:11,833
Did she fall for you?
I already told you.

862
01:02:11,916 --> 01:02:13,041
Get out!

863
01:02:22,416 --> 01:02:26,041
<i>Who can be a better match to me?</i>
<i>Why didn’t I realize this before, Ammu?</i>

864
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:28,208
<i>Love is like chewing gum</i>

865
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:30,375
<i>It sticks with you</i>
<i>And doesn’t let go</i>

866
01:02:30,708 --> 01:02:32,750
<i>People have said this before</i>

867
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:34,416
<i>But let me say it again</i>

868
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:36,583
<i>I can’t hold it in</i>

869
01:02:36,666 --> 01:02:38,916
<i>You can’t restrain from love</i>

870
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:46,708
<i>You are everything</i>
<i>I’ve been looking for</i>

871
01:02:47,125 --> 01:02:54,833
<i>You became a part of me</i>
<i>Before I knew it</i>

872
01:02:55,416 --> 01:02:57,416
<i>Hey, pretty doll</i>

873
01:02:57,541 --> 01:02:59,541
<i>You’ve surrounded my thoughts</i>

874
01:02:59,666 --> 01:03:03,583
<i>You’ve held my hand in togetherness</i>

875
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:05,875
<i>Hey, pretty doll</i>

876
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
<i>You’ve surrounded my thoughts</i>

877
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:12,041
<i>You’ve held my hand in togetherness</i>

878
01:03:20,833 --> 01:03:24,458
<i>I might have been quiet</i>
<i>like an audience in a theater</i>

879
01:03:24,666 --> 01:03:26,583
<i>But there are drums</i>
<i>Playing in my heart</i>

880
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:29,041
<i>I might have just</i>
<i>Had a brain freeze</i>

881
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:06,583
<i>This isn’t the Kings’ times,</i>
<i>No chariot or horses</i>

882
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:10,333
<i>I fight a battle against myself</i>
<i>In front of the mirror</i>

883
01:04:10,916 --> 01:04:14,916
<i>You put forward your hands filled</i>
<i>With bangles and come close</i>

884
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:19,125
<i>You caress my cheeks and</i>
<i>Make me feel like a King</i>

885
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:22,833
<i>I asked for pitter-patter raindrops</i>

886
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:27,000
<i>You’ve given me a cyclone</i>

887
01:04:27,625 --> 01:04:31,583
<i>I asked for a little jasmine</i>

888
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:35,208
<i>You showered me with flowers</i>

889
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:37,625
<i>Hey, pretty doll</i>

890
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:39,750
<i>You’ve surrounded my thoughts</i>

891
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:43,791
<i>You’ve held my hand in togetherness</i>

892
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:48,000
<i>You’ve made me an eternal part of you</i>

893
01:04:48,166 --> 01:04:52,083
<i>You’ve given me a special place</i>
<i>In your heart</i>

894
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,625
<i>Who can be a better match to me?</i>
<i>Why didn’t I realize this before, Ammu?</i>

895
01:05:04,833 --> 01:05:06,791
<i>Love is like chewing gum</i>

896
01:05:06,916 --> 01:05:08,958
<i>It sticks with you</i>
<i>And doesn’t let go</i>

897
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:11,333
<i>People have said this before</i>

898
01:05:11,416 --> 01:05:13,000
<i>But let me say it again</i>

899
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:15,166
<i>I can’t hold it in</i>

900
01:05:15,291 --> 01:05:17,541
<i>You can’t restrain from love</i>

901
01:05:36,875 --> 01:05:38,125
He’ll be seeing you now.

902
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:40,166
I’m Appala Naidu.

903
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:43,375
I control everything
in the port.

904
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:47,250
I got my son into college so that
he has a different lifestyle.

905
01:05:48,916 --> 01:05:51,375
I sent him to you with money
because your company needed it.

906
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:55,166
My son made it clear that
we don’t need your money.

907
01:05:57,291 --> 01:06:00,041
Your son might listen
to whatever you say.

908
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:03,041
But I'll give my son
whatever her asks for.

909
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:05,500
If you try to stop it.

910
01:06:14,916 --> 01:06:17,458
People from Kolkata
love to eat fish brains.

911
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:19,500
People from Andhra
love its tail.

912
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:22,708
But the fish loves to live.

913
01:06:32,333 --> 01:06:35,750
To do so, it must stay
farther away from the net.

914
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:39,500
Once it falls into the
net, there’s no going back.

915
01:06:47,625 --> 01:06:49,541
Let’s tell him later… not now.

916
01:06:49,666 --> 01:06:51,166
We've have come very far.

917
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:52,791
Let's tell the truth.

918
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:02,416
Where is he?

919
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:05,375
Maybe he is in the restroom.

920
01:07:06,416 --> 01:07:08,791
-Sit down.
-It’s okay.

921
01:07:32,541 --> 01:07:35,291
-Shall I call the ambulance?
-No… call the car driver.

922
01:07:43,041 --> 01:07:44,083
Hey! Hey!

923
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:04,000
Where’s the staircase?

924
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:18,333
What happened?

925
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:25,541
-Any chances of making it?
-Only God can save him now.

926
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:27,625
God doesn’t exist anymore.

927
01:08:28,208 --> 01:08:29,750
Move... let him breathe.

928
01:08:29,958 --> 01:08:32,541
-Shall I call his family?
-Not now... Later.

929
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,708
Hey!

930
01:09:24,041 --> 01:09:24,958
Hey!

931
01:09:26,833 --> 01:09:29,000
-That’s our car.
-We stabbed him.

932
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:30,041
Let it go.

933
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:32,916
-You said he had no chance.
-You said God didn’t exist.

934
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:48,750
I'll inform his family.

935
01:10:26,166 --> 01:10:27,416
Calm down, ma’am.

936
01:10:27,666 --> 01:10:28,708
One moment.

937
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:43,958
Do you know him?

938
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:48,458
-What…
-What happened?

939
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:50,625
Someone...

940
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:56,541
He met with a small accident.

941
01:10:57,208 --> 01:11:00,333
Don’t worry. He’s fine.

942
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:05,583
Is he your father?

943
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:07,958
My father?

944
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:10,375
Sadly, no.

945
01:11:11,541 --> 01:11:12,416
No.

946
01:11:16,333 --> 01:11:18,750
He's my father.

947
01:11:19,833 --> 01:11:20,833
He's there.

948
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:42,916
Tell me.

949
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:45,708
That’s not your father.

950
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:49,166
Your father is...
Ra... Ra... Rama...

951
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:51,250
It doesn’t change the
fact that he’s my father.

952
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:52,583
You need to relax.

953
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:55,958
Please sit, sir.
I’ll check if ma'am is here.

954
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:01,500
He’s... he’s not your father.

955
01:12:02,625 --> 01:12:06,208
He’s not your father.

956
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:10,000
I don’t think you’re feeling well.
Let me call the doctor.

957
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:12,416
Wait a minute... stop talking.

958
01:12:15,625 --> 01:12:17,875
He’s... not your father.

959
01:12:20,541 --> 01:12:22,250
He’s Valmiki.

960
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:26,000
You know my father?

961
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:30,666
Valmiki is not your father.

962
01:12:30,916 --> 01:12:32,541
Valmiki is not your father.

963
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:40,958
Ramachandra... is your father.

964
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:45,916
What do you mean?
I don’t get it.

965
01:12:46,041 --> 01:12:48,708
Yes...
Ramachandra is your father.

966
01:12:49,083 --> 01:12:51,916
I switched you.

967
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:58,000
You didn’t move
when you were born.

968
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,500
Before I could tell
the doctor about it...

969
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:23,791
Your... your name?

970
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:30,916
You were born as Raj.

971
01:13:33,791 --> 01:13:35,250
You are the real Raj.

972
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:40,375
I picked you up from
the rich side...

973
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,791
and put you into a poor family.

974
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,750
That guilt is killing me.

975
01:13:46,208 --> 01:13:49,000
Only God and I know that.

976
01:13:49,541 --> 01:13:55,125
I have to tell this to
your father before I die.

977
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:57,500
I should only tell him.

978
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:00,250
Call him...

979
01:14:00,708 --> 01:14:02,708
Raj... call your father.

980
01:14:03,041 --> 01:14:03,875
Call him!

981
01:14:04,333 --> 01:14:06,250
Get Ramachandra here.

982
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:07,625
Call him.

983
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:11,125
Raj... Raj... call your father.

984
01:14:11,291 --> 01:14:12,916
Get Ramachandra.

985
01:14:13,208 --> 01:14:14,166
Call him.

986
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:16,291
He's inside.

987
01:14:33,375 --> 01:14:34,708
What is the patient doing here?

988
01:14:37,375 --> 01:14:38,958
Sister, what are you doing?

989
01:14:40,416 --> 01:14:41,500
You’re supposed to be alert.

990
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:43,125
What is this patient doing here?

991
01:14:44,458 --> 01:14:46,250
-Is Dr. Bhaskar Reddy available?
-Yes, sir.

992
01:14:46,541 --> 01:14:47,583
Let’s shift her
to critical care.

993
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:30,791
-My daughter…
-On the way, sir.

994
01:15:33,708 --> 01:15:34,875
I spoke with the doctors.

995
01:15:34,958 --> 01:15:36,750
His heart is totally fine.
Just some blood loss.

996
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,458
He should recover soon.

997
01:15:38,583 --> 01:15:40,416
No issues so far...
I have it all sorted.

998
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:42,375
I don’t think so, Kasi.

999
01:16:06,708 --> 01:16:07,708
Hello, ma’am.

1000
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:10,416
-Where’s father?
-He’s sitting in the back.

1001
01:16:10,708 --> 01:16:12,250
-Call him.
-Okay, ma’am.

1002
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:26,500
Who is he?

1003
01:16:31,208 --> 01:16:33,375
So, it’s you brother-in-law
was bragging about.

1004
01:16:35,375 --> 01:16:37,666
He saved uncle.

1005
01:16:39,958 --> 01:16:41,833
He was also at the
hotel last time.

1006
01:16:43,291 --> 01:16:44,291
I didn’t notice.

1007
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:49,541
Ask him to wait downstairs.
I’ll talk to him later.

1008
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:09,083
Father,
DCP wants to talk to you.

1009
01:17:11,583 --> 01:17:12,583
Come dear.

1010
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:17,875
Let’s go.

1011
01:17:18,208 --> 01:17:19,666
This is how the
rich people are...

1012
01:17:20,125 --> 01:17:22,458
They never fail to
remind us our place.

1013
01:17:22,958 --> 01:17:24,875
We can never be one of them.

1014
01:17:28,083 --> 01:17:29,625
I’ve been working with
them for 25 years.

1015
01:17:31,833 --> 01:17:33,875
But they never let me in.

1016
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:37,291
We should get used to this.

1017
01:17:37,416 --> 01:17:38,375
That’s the way it is.

1018
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:41,250
We’re strangers.

1019
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:42,916
We must behave like strangers.

1020
01:17:44,416 --> 01:17:45,541
You know what they say.

1021
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:48,125
A King’s Palace hosts
the prosperous alone.

1022
01:17:48,666 --> 01:17:51,958
Just because he’s
gotten close to us...

1023
01:17:54,125 --> 01:17:55,458
We shouldn’t think like that.

1024
01:17:57,458 --> 01:17:58,625
She’s no more.

1025
01:18:01,541 --> 01:18:02,500
Poor lady.

1026
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:10,125
Take her away.

1027
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:16,041
Do you know her?

1028
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:18,166
Must be an orphan.

1029
01:18:18,833 --> 01:18:20,500
You know I am very sensitive.

1030
01:18:20,833 --> 01:18:21,833
I can’t take it.

1031
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:24,541
She must’ve done
something bad.

1032
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:26,041
She had a remorseful death.

1033
01:18:26,625 --> 01:18:28,250
God’s watching over all of us.

1034
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:36,666
You have something to say?

1035
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:46,791
Hey! How dare you!

1036
01:18:51,208 --> 01:18:54,000
I’m annoyed listening to
your lies from childhood.

1037
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:57,083
But you never stop it.

1038
01:18:58,583 --> 01:19:00,458
Actually,
why don’t you take a break?

1039
01:19:28,583 --> 01:19:29,416
Hey!

1040
01:19:29,916 --> 01:19:31,541
Sit properly...
you are leaning on me.

1041
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:34,125
As soon as you do
something good...

1042
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:35,625
you can’t resist
doing something bad.

1043
01:19:36,541 --> 01:19:38,333
You can ask me why I hit you.

1044
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:39,750
Why are you beating
around the bush?

1045
01:19:48,333 --> 01:19:51,833
You just hit your dad and you’re
passing statements about it?

1046
01:19:53,416 --> 01:19:56,708
We’re in the middle of the road.
Do you have something to say?

1047
01:19:58,875 --> 01:19:59,958
You’re not the real father.

1048
01:20:00,541 --> 01:20:02,000
That is why I hit you.

1049
01:20:15,166 --> 01:20:16,916
I’m not your father?

1050
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,916
I’m not your father?

1051
01:20:20,333 --> 01:20:21,875
How do you think
you were born then?

1052
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,458
Did you pop out of thin air?

1053
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:25,208
No, I didn’t.

1054
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:27,166
You got me down.

1055
01:20:39,958 --> 01:20:41,833
That nurse was in
coma for 25 years.

1056
01:20:43,166 --> 01:20:45,375
How can you believe
whatever she mumbles?

1057
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:48,500
I don’t remember mentioning
anything about a nurse.

1058
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:03,541
Tell me.

1059
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:06,708
Is Ramachandra my father?

1060
01:21:08,416 --> 01:21:09,750
Yes or no?

1061
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:16,875
You couldn’t shut up ever since I was
born. Now speak up!

1062
01:21:17,875 --> 01:21:18,958
Tell me!

1063
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:20,291
I...

1064
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,083
I just wanted my
son to be happy.

1065
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:25,458
I get that part.
But why did you torture me?

1066
01:21:30,625 --> 01:21:32,125
You are jealous of my father.

1067
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:35,458
He started along with you and
became a millionaire in no time.

1068
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:36,916
You couldn’t take it.

1069
01:21:37,375 --> 01:21:39,375
But there’s nothing
you can do to him.

1070
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,666
So, you picture Ramachandra in me.

1071
01:21:41,791 --> 01:21:45,875
Exactly why you’ve been
troubling me for 25 years.

1072
01:21:48,916 --> 01:21:50,125
You drove me crazy.

1073
01:21:50,708 --> 01:21:52,125
What have I done to you?

1074
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:02,458
Drink it...
You look like you’re going to die.

1075
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,833
Will you reveal everything and
expose me in front of everyone?

1076
01:22:16,958 --> 01:22:18,958
Will you ruin my son’s life?

1077
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:22,208
I'm begging you.
Please don’t tell anyone.

1078
01:22:22,375 --> 01:22:25,250
If I reveal the truth...

1079
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:28,875
they will abandon
your son right away.

1080
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:31,000
His mother will
become his madam.

1081
01:22:31,375 --> 01:22:32,750
His father will become his boss.

1082
01:22:33,041 --> 01:22:35,166
A clerk like you will
be his real father.

1083
01:22:35,291 --> 01:22:37,208
He will commit suicide
out of depression and die.

1084
01:22:39,291 --> 01:22:41,625
I considered all this and
chose to be silent back there.

1085
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:46,916
Besides, it’s my mother who’s
going to weep if I expose you.

1086
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:50,125
I can’t call her auntie after she
nurtured me for all these years.

1087
01:22:50,791 --> 01:22:53,333
I can’t call her my mom
just for the sake of wealth.

1088
01:22:55,875 --> 01:23:00,041
I don’t want your wealth or their stature.
You only keep it. I don’t need it.

1089
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:07,500
You don’t want any of it.

1090
01:23:08,291 --> 01:23:10,125
What will you get from
knowing the truth?

1091
01:23:12,041 --> 01:23:14,166
The freedom of knowing that
I don’t have to impress you.

1092
01:23:15,041 --> 01:23:18,166
Ever since I was a kid,
I’ve been looking for ways to impress you.

1093
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:20,500
Now I realized you’re not
going to like me after all.

1094
01:23:20,666 --> 01:23:21,791
I’ve found my answer.

1095
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:33,833
I always get irritated
when I see you.

1096
01:23:33,916 --> 01:23:36,083
But for the first time,
I feel sorry for you.

1097
01:23:37,041 --> 01:23:39,583
Because...
you can’t claim him as your son.

1098
01:23:39,916 --> 01:23:41,333
I won’t accept you as my father.

1099
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:42,500
Few lives don’t get any better.

1100
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:51,916
My vehicle has insurance.

1101
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,625
I'm sure he won’t tell anyone.

1102
01:23:54,958 --> 01:23:56,125
Oh God!

1103
01:24:00,166 --> 01:24:01,166
Mother...

1104
01:24:03,333 --> 01:24:04,666
Aren’t you feeling well?

1105
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:07,041
Sister told me you
didn't eat anything.

1106
01:24:07,166 --> 01:24:09,375
I’ve been having
temperature since evening.

1107
01:24:09,625 --> 01:24:10,541
Your boiling.

1108
01:24:10,791 --> 01:24:12,416
Wait.
I’ll get you some medicine.

1109
01:24:12,916 --> 01:24:13,875
Wait.

1110
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:15,541
No.

1111
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:18,541
You can’t do this.
Get her some medicines.

1112
01:24:19,166 --> 01:24:20,416
No.

1113
01:24:20,583 --> 01:24:22,041
I just want my
kids to comfort me.

1114
01:24:22,166 --> 01:24:23,833
I will get better.

1115
01:24:33,583 --> 01:24:36,666
I want to meet your son.

1116
01:24:37,875 --> 01:24:40,333
I'll give him a
hug and thank him.

1117
01:24:40,916 --> 01:24:41,750
Get him once.

1118
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:44,666
I’m the doctor that
treated your son-in-law.

1119
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:45,916
She’s the nurse
that assisted me.

1120
01:24:46,041 --> 01:24:47,875
You need to hug the
both of us and thank us.

1121
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:50,333
How could you think someone
else is more important?

1122
01:24:50,458 --> 01:24:51,458
-Who is he?
-Hey!

1123
01:24:55,833 --> 01:24:57,333
Come with me for a moment.

1124
01:24:57,708 --> 01:25:00,083
We shouldn’t upset
doctors and drivers.

1125
01:25:00,291 --> 01:25:02,000
The syringes and steering
wheels are in their control.

1126
01:25:02,125 --> 01:25:03,541
Let’s get out of here.

1127
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:05,458
What’s the matter, Dad?

1128
01:26:01,291 --> 01:26:03,208
You were supposed to
be here yesterday.

1129
01:26:04,041 --> 01:26:06,500
But no one told me about it.

1130
01:26:06,666 --> 01:26:12,083
A son is supposed to check
on his father and mother.

1131
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:16,666
And also, on what’s going
on around the house.

1132
01:26:17,458 --> 01:26:18,916
Nobody will tell you.

1133
01:26:20,291 --> 01:26:22,500
I can’t believe you brought
a bouquet like some stranger.

1134
01:26:28,541 --> 01:26:29,583
How much is the bill?

1135
01:26:31,166 --> 01:26:32,291
Change the figure. Ten lakhs.

1136
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,333
The figure for one lakh
twenty thousand would be one lakh.

1137
01:26:34,416 --> 01:26:35,333
Not ten lakhs.

1138
01:26:36,541 --> 01:26:37,625
You’re not Subrahmanyam.

1139
01:26:37,958 --> 01:26:39,250
-No.
-What’s up, sir?

1140
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:42,083
He knows nothing
about figures.

1141
01:26:42,166 --> 01:26:43,125
Explain it to him.

1142
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:46,250
If we charge the medicines at ten lakhs...

1143
01:26:46,333 --> 01:26:47,666
This bill is going to top Jayalalitha’s.

1144
01:26:48,041 --> 01:26:49,875
Luckily, she didn’t have
a brother like him.

1145
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:52,041
Otherwise, her bill would
have crossed the state budget.

1146
01:26:57,666 --> 01:26:59,583
Her husband is in a
critical condition.

1147
01:26:59,875 --> 01:27:02,083
And yet,
she hasn’t shed a single tear.

1148
01:27:03,166 --> 01:27:08,708
She didn’t sob for him like we did.

1149
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:12,375
Really?

1150
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:14,208
Yeah!

1151
01:27:14,875 --> 01:27:15,875
What?

1152
01:27:16,666 --> 01:27:18,750
They are of a different class.

1153
01:27:19,208 --> 01:27:20,333
Different class?

1154
01:27:20,666 --> 01:27:21,875
Are you crazy?

1155
01:27:22,333 --> 01:27:24,041
The husband and the wife don’t
have a proper conversation.

1156
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:26,625
His son gets him a bouquet
like he’s a stranger.

1157
01:27:27,541 --> 01:27:29,083
Don’t even get me started
on his brother-in-law.

1158
01:27:29,291 --> 01:27:31,916
He’s looting all their money
in the name of hospital bills.

1159
01:27:32,083 --> 01:27:33,416
Why do we care about them?

1160
01:27:33,958 --> 01:27:35,000
I don’t get it.

1161
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:36,625
How come the father and the son

1162
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:38,625
are having a conversation
without turning it into a fight?

1163
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:39,583
It’s nothing.

1164
01:27:39,666 --> 01:27:42,750
I was telling him that
house is like a temple.

1165
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:47,333
And the couple is like
Lord Shiva and Parvathi.

1166
01:27:47,416 --> 01:27:48,916
That's it.

1167
01:27:49,166 --> 01:27:50,291
You call that a temple?

1168
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:52,625
Who are you then?
The priest’s sidekick?

1169
01:27:53,291 --> 01:27:55,125
Not a single member in
that family has values.

1170
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:57,125
If they keep this going...

1171
01:27:58,291 --> 01:27:59,500
my father will die.

1172
01:28:01,625 --> 01:28:03,291
Stop bragging that
he is your father.

1173
01:28:03,375 --> 01:28:04,458
I’m your father.

1174
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,666
If you ever say that again,
I’ll kill your mom and kill myself next.

1175
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:08,875
I swear on God!

1176
01:28:09,541 --> 01:28:10,708
Why are you getting
my mom into this?

1177
01:28:10,833 --> 01:28:12,500
Because you wouldn’t
care if I died alone.

1178
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:18,500
You have something to say now?

1179
01:28:20,666 --> 01:28:22,041
I want to go to that house.

1180
01:28:24,041 --> 01:28:25,083
What happened?

1181
01:28:25,541 --> 01:28:27,541
-Dad choked.
-Give him some water.

1182
01:28:27,625 --> 01:28:28,750
I’m at it.

1183
01:28:29,291 --> 01:28:30,291
Drink.

1184
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:31,666
Drink it.

1185
01:28:34,541 --> 01:28:38,791
You’ve been checking on your
son since the last 25 years.

1186
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:42,875
Now it’s my turn
to check on my dad.

1187
01:28:43,375 --> 01:28:44,208
Hey...

1188
01:28:46,916 --> 01:28:49,000
You can check on your Prince.

1189
01:28:49,166 --> 01:28:52,083
But I can’t check on my King?

1190
01:28:54,375 --> 01:28:57,416
Even if you’re in the same
room with Ramachandra...

1191
01:28:58,208 --> 01:29:00,750
he’s going to take you in right away.
You’re his blood after all.

1192
01:29:02,166 --> 01:29:05,791
That is what kept me from
taking you to that house.

1193
01:29:08,125 --> 01:29:10,458
Besides, would you stay
away once you got in?

1194
01:29:13,625 --> 01:29:16,458
You’re like a chewing
gum stuck on the shoe.

1195
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:18,875
I’ll never let you go there.

1196
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:21,833
Who can get me in other than you?
You’re going to take me there.

1197
01:29:22,166 --> 01:29:23,666
-Me?
-Yeah. Tomorrow.

1198
01:29:33,916 --> 01:29:36,166
You better lose the
T-shirts for a while, sir.

1199
01:29:36,333 --> 01:29:37,541
Shirts will be comfortable.

1200
01:29:38,333 --> 01:29:39,916
-Why?
-Not again!

1201
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:43,666
My son-in-law is not too
old to wear a T-shirt.

1202
01:29:44,375 --> 01:29:46,750
Hey! What does a T-shirt
have to do with it?

1203
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:49,791
Wearing a dhoti doesn’t
make you any better.

1204
01:29:51,125 --> 01:29:52,958
Calm down, doctor.

1205
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:04,666
Get it?

1206
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,958
But you don’t understand.

1207
01:30:08,291 --> 01:30:09,583
You can wear shorts if you want.

1208
01:30:09,708 --> 01:30:11,750
Your calves will get some fresh air.
What about you?

1209
01:30:12,416 --> 01:30:13,250
What?

1210
01:30:13,333 --> 01:30:15,291
-Not again.
-Hang on.

1211
01:30:20,666 --> 01:30:24,916
He needs pleasant people around.

1212
01:30:25,166 --> 01:30:26,583
Especially people unlike us.

1213
01:30:29,083 --> 01:30:32,333
That guy who brought
him to the hospital.

1214
01:30:32,583 --> 01:30:34,916
Why don’t you just
call the same guy?

1215
01:30:38,625 --> 01:30:39,500
Come here!

1216
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:42,083
See?

1217
01:30:42,416 --> 01:30:45,791
Your son-in-law’s BP is normal
as soon as I mentioned that guy.

1218
01:30:46,166 --> 01:30:47,041
Look.

1219
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:49,791
How is his presence going
to help medically, doctor?

1220
01:30:49,875 --> 01:30:51,208
You will see for yourself.

1221
01:30:51,833 --> 01:30:56,041
In the movies, a child gets better
when his mom or dad visits him.

1222
01:30:56,166 --> 01:30:57,208
You believe in that stuff.

1223
01:30:57,291 --> 01:31:00,000
But you don’t believe in an
overqualified doctor like me.

1224
01:31:00,125 --> 01:31:01,583
You question my credibility.

1225
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:04,625
But you didn’t want
him here last time.

1226
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:07,333
Answer him.

1227
01:31:07,583 --> 01:31:08,583
I will.

1228
01:31:09,708 --> 01:31:10,708
Didn’t you say that?

1229
01:31:10,875 --> 01:31:11,791
I did, sir.

1230
01:31:12,083 --> 01:31:13,333
But people change.

1231
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:14,541
Give me a chance, will you?

1232
01:31:14,791 --> 01:31:17,333
Even doctors and
drivers have kids.

1233
01:31:22,166 --> 01:31:24,375
The doctor’s BP might
rise from all the yelling.

1234
01:31:24,958 --> 01:31:26,083
Go get him.

1235
01:31:26,208 --> 01:31:28,083
He’ll be at work now.

1236
01:31:28,375 --> 01:31:29,500
Ask him to take permission
for a few hours.

1237
01:31:29,625 --> 01:31:31,791
-It’s not a government office.
-Ask him to take the rest of the day off.

1238
01:31:31,958 --> 01:31:33,125
What reason would he give?

1239
01:31:33,208 --> 01:31:34,625
Just ask him to quit the job.
Good riddance!

1240
01:31:34,708 --> 01:31:37,083
-That’s his bread and butter, doctor.
-Send him to my house.

1241
01:31:37,166 --> 01:31:38,625
I’ll feed him bread and butter.

1242
01:31:38,916 --> 01:31:41,375
-It’s no big deal. Let’s hire him.
-Yes!

1243
01:31:41,541 --> 01:31:43,958
You’re always giving some excuse
whenever I want to see him.

1244
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:45,375
Don’t you want him here?

1245
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,250
-What’s your problem?
-What’s your problem?

1246
01:31:47,375 --> 01:31:49,875
-I don’t have any problem.
-Then call him.

1247
01:31:50,416 --> 01:31:51,958
Battery is low. I will...

1248
01:31:52,041 --> 01:31:54,125
-Give me his number. I’ll call him.
-I will only call him.

1249
01:31:57,625 --> 01:32:00,416
Hello...
Why are you stepping out?

1250
01:32:01,875 --> 01:32:03,291
Because the signals
are better there.

1251
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,625
Make the call quickly and
my life will be better.

1252
01:32:06,916 --> 01:32:08,125
You must be lucky.

1253
01:32:08,833 --> 01:32:10,500
Yesterday you told me.
Today they are only inviting you.

1254
01:32:11,416 --> 01:32:13,166
Every fool has his day.

1255
01:32:13,375 --> 01:32:14,625
Today is your day.

1256
01:32:14,958 --> 01:32:17,500
Just because they invited you,
doesn’t mean I’ll let you come.

1257
01:32:19,583 --> 01:32:23,708
I’ll give them some lame
excuse to keep you away.

1258
01:32:24,333 --> 01:32:26,250
The doctor will call me
as soon as you hang up.

1259
01:32:29,166 --> 01:32:30,833
How do you know there’s
a doctor inside?

1260
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,375
Where are you?

1261
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:34,791
Stop limping and look up.

1262
01:32:44,541 --> 01:32:46,583
Hey! What’s with the doctor?

1263
01:32:46,833 --> 01:32:48,208
He hated you last time.

1264
01:32:48,541 --> 01:32:52,791
But now, he’s acting like
some die-hard fan of yours.

1265
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:56,416
It’s an obvious reaction for
someone who had his son kidnapped.

1266
01:32:56,958 --> 01:32:58,458
You kidnapped his son?

1267
01:32:58,666 --> 01:32:59,750
It's him.

1268
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:02,500
This fatso?

1269
01:33:04,791 --> 01:33:05,750
Is he coming?

1270
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:06,875
Yes, sir.

1271
01:33:07,041 --> 01:33:09,291
This doctor is killing me.

1272
01:33:09,791 --> 01:33:10,916
Please come.

1273
01:33:18,541 --> 01:33:21,666
<i>In a far-off city named Vaikunthapuram</i>

1274
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:26,958
<i>Further away from</i>
<i>The humongous palace</i>

1275
01:33:27,166 --> 01:33:31,791
<i>At the shore of a sea filled with nectar</i>

1276
01:33:31,875 --> 01:33:36,375
<i>There was a dais shining like the moon</i>

1277
01:33:36,875 --> 01:33:41,041
<i>Lord Vishnu was seated with Goddess Laxmi</i>

1278
01:33:41,125 --> 01:33:44,916
<i>On a throne adorned with black lotuses</i>

1279
01:33:45,291 --> 01:33:51,041
<i>Being the holy savior, he rushes to</i>

1280
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:57,625
<i>The rescue of the helpless Gajendra</i>

1281
01:34:17,958 --> 01:34:22,375
<i>Here sets foot a new relationship</i>
<i>In the abode of Vaikunthapuram</i>

1282
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:27,375
<i>Here comes the epitome of joy</i>
<i>To a place weeping with sadness</i>

1283
01:34:36,958 --> 01:34:41,500
<i>Here forms a new acquaintance</i>
<i>In the abode of Vaikunthapuram</i>

1284
01:34:41,666 --> 01:34:46,208
<i>Here he brings happiness to</i>
<i>People flooding with tears</i>

1285
01:34:46,333 --> 01:34:51,083
<i>Here holds an umbrella</i>
<i>The sky for the cloud arriving</i>

1286
01:34:51,208 --> 01:34:55,750
<i>Here sighs with relief the world</i>
<i>For he will be a pillar of support</i>

1287
01:34:55,833 --> 01:34:59,750
<i>Here welcomes the ravishing sun</i>
<i>As the holy vermilion</i>

1288
01:34:59,833 --> 01:35:01,708
<i>In the abode of Vaikunthapuram...</i>

1289
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:06,500
<i>In the abode of Vaikunthapuram...</i>

1290
01:35:09,208 --> 01:35:11,375
<i>In the abode of Vaikunthapuram...</i>

1291
01:35:13,916 --> 01:35:16,208
<i>In the abode of Vaikunthapuram...</i>

1292
01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:21,833
Hey! Why did you give her money?

1293
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:55,041
My son.

1294
01:35:56,458 --> 01:35:57,291
And my son?

1295
01:35:58,958 --> 01:35:59,791
He’s at the tea shop.

1296
01:35:59,875 --> 01:36:00,958
I’ll be there in a second.

1297
01:36:01,833 --> 01:36:03,500
-I didn’t pay for the tea.
-I will.

1298
01:36:04,583 --> 01:36:05,750
He has my headphones.

1299
01:36:05,833 --> 01:36:07,291
I’ll get you new headphones.

1300
01:36:07,541 --> 01:36:09,958
You guys are criminals
for kidnapping kids.

1301
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:15,000
Your father has been
hiding you like a bride.

1302
01:36:16,875 --> 01:36:18,541
I never got to take
a good look at you.

1303
01:36:18,833 --> 01:36:19,750
Come forward.

1304
01:36:39,916 --> 01:36:40,875
He’s good.

1305
01:36:44,291 --> 01:36:45,458
You’re a tough man.

1306
01:36:46,958 --> 01:36:49,083
You didn’t just carry my
son-in-law the other day.

1307
01:36:51,166 --> 01:36:57,791
You carried the prestige of this
house, ARK Company and our hopes.

1308
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:03,208
You work for my
granddaughter, right?

1309
01:37:03,291 --> 01:37:04,333
Yes, sir.

1310
01:37:04,708 --> 01:37:06,250
-Is she paying you well?
-Yes, sir.

1311
01:37:06,541 --> 01:37:07,375
How much?

1312
01:37:07,458 --> 01:37:12,208
I was promised 25 thousand… I get 20
thousand after all the exclusions.

1313
01:37:12,541 --> 01:37:13,708
I’ll pay you 50 thousand.
Come work for me.

1314
01:37:14,375 --> 01:37:17,708
Sir! He’ll be spoiled if you
promise him so much money.

1315
01:37:17,916 --> 01:37:19,208
What are you talking?

1316
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:21,166
You’ll be spoiling him
if you gave him money.

1317
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:22,625
But we will be encouraging him.

1318
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:23,583
No, sir...

1319
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:25,125
-Work for me.
-Sure, sir.

1320
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,541
Choose any room you like and
find a desk and a computer.

1321
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:33,208
-But what would I do?
-Exactly my question.

1322
01:37:34,083 --> 01:37:36,166
He will watch pictures
of girls on the Internet.

1323
01:37:39,541 --> 01:37:42,291
We can think about that later.

1324
01:37:44,791 --> 01:37:48,541
I have a lot of people to
meet and loads of work to do.

1325
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:49,791
Time for you to leave.

1326
01:37:50,083 --> 01:37:51,083
Go!

1327
01:37:51,166 --> 01:37:52,208
Idiot.

1328
01:37:52,583 --> 01:37:54,500
You need to be straightforward
in everything you do.

1329
01:37:54,625 --> 01:37:56,416
I hate people who lie.

1330
01:37:56,666 --> 01:37:57,625
What?

1331
01:37:59,541 --> 01:38:03,416
You just proved that you could
insist on something you don’t do.

1332
01:38:04,208 --> 01:38:07,041
You’re an inspiration
to a set of people, sir.

1333
01:38:08,208 --> 01:38:10,416
I'm an inspiration?

1334
01:38:11,666 --> 01:38:13,083
Hey, ma’am! How are you doing?

1335
01:38:13,541 --> 01:38:14,791
Didn’t you recognize me?

1336
01:38:14,916 --> 01:38:16,208
Come. Sit.

1337
01:38:16,458 --> 01:38:19,250
I was at the hotel for
madam’s engagement, remember?

1338
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:27,666
Never mind, ma’am.
I know you don’t remember me.

1339
01:38:29,333 --> 01:38:30,708
I don’t mind.

1340
01:38:30,916 --> 01:38:33,208
Hero Chiranjeevi
waves at his fans.

1341
01:38:33,666 --> 01:38:35,750
It doesn’t mean he knows
all their names.

1342
01:38:35,916 --> 01:38:36,916
It's the same for you.

1343
01:38:37,041 --> 01:38:39,875
You’re like a star.
And I’m like your biggest fan.

1344
01:38:43,833 --> 01:38:45,625
See?
Even I have a good following.

1345
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:51,375
Of course.

1346
01:38:51,541 --> 01:38:55,416
To be honest... you might look
above average but you’re super sexy.

1347
01:38:55,958 --> 01:38:56,791
Yes.

1348
01:38:58,083 --> 01:38:59,583
Don’t hit your fans.

1349
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:03,958
Bro, come here.

1350
01:39:04,083 --> 01:39:05,250
Tell me, bro.

1351
01:39:05,333 --> 01:39:07,041
Just look at her…
she’s superhot.

1352
01:39:07,166 --> 01:39:09,000
I can't make those comments.
Tell me what this is about.

1353
01:39:09,125 --> 01:39:12,750
Let me know who her
close relatives are here.

1354
01:39:12,833 --> 01:39:13,958
I want to be friends with them.

1355
01:39:14,041 --> 01:39:15,166
-Not possible.
-Why?

1356
01:39:15,291 --> 01:39:16,583
I’m her uncle.

1357
01:39:16,916 --> 01:39:18,000
Sorry, sir.

1358
01:39:18,166 --> 01:39:20,125
Going by your clothes,
I thought you were the maid.

1359
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:21,458
What do you mean?

1360
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
You want me to suit
up at home as well?

1361
01:39:25,666 --> 01:39:26,791
How do you like the house?

1362
01:39:27,041 --> 01:39:28,416
It’s wonderful, sir.

1363
01:39:28,791 --> 01:39:32,250
But I don’t like that fact that he was
attacked despite having all of you around.

1364
01:39:32,875 --> 01:39:34,708
Why didn’t you file
a police complaint?

1365
01:39:35,083 --> 01:39:36,458
We did, man.

1366
01:39:37,958 --> 01:39:39,791
-We did file a complaint.
-You can be informal with me.

1367
01:39:39,875 --> 01:39:41,458
You’re elder to me.

1368
01:39:43,208 --> 01:39:45,166
The guy we’re dealing with
is quite powerful as well.

1369
01:39:45,416 --> 01:39:47,041
We don’t have enough
evidence to support the case.

1370
01:39:47,541 --> 01:39:51,583
So, the police are
afraid to arrest him.

1371
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,125
Why is that stopping us?
We'll go and talk to him.

1372
01:39:55,583 --> 01:39:56,666
-Shall we?
-Yeah!

1373
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:34,541
Who are you?

1374
01:40:34,833 --> 01:40:36,708
This is too much, Paidithalli.

1375
01:40:37,666 --> 01:40:39,958
You want shares in his company. You want
to be the director of his company.

1376
01:40:40,041 --> 01:40:41,250
You also want his position
if you can have it.

1377
01:40:41,333 --> 01:40:42,791
But you don’t know him.

1378
01:40:48,791 --> 01:40:50,416
Who let you in?

1379
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:51,916
It was very hard to come here...

1380
01:40:52,041 --> 01:40:54,458
We took flight until Rajahmundry
and in a car until Kakinada.

1381
01:40:54,541 --> 01:40:55,833
After reaching this place…

1382
01:40:56,416 --> 01:40:57,708
it was uncomfortable.

1383
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:06,500
Sir, you can’t go in.

1384
01:41:12,416 --> 01:41:13,958
Let’s go. Start the vehicle.

1385
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:17,083
No, sir. We traveled so far.

1386
01:41:26,041 --> 01:41:28,000
That hand print…

1387
01:41:28,708 --> 01:41:30,708
Who pushed him?

1388
01:41:35,375 --> 01:41:39,166
My nephew visited your office and you
asked him to get out in a video call.

1389
01:41:39,708 --> 01:41:41,958
But you expect grand
welcome from us?

1390
01:41:42,958 --> 01:41:44,500
Impossible!

1391
01:41:45,208 --> 01:41:47,250
-My load is in there.
-So what?

1392
01:41:47,625 --> 01:41:50,666
I am giving you 25 to 30
crores business every year.

1393
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:52,708
So what?

1394
01:41:52,958 --> 01:41:54,708
Hey! I need to go inside.

1395
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:04,208
Don’t you get it, old man?

1396
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:29,291
Lift the load. Come on.

1397
01:42:32,875 --> 01:42:34,458
Who pushed him?

1398
01:42:34,583 --> 01:42:36,916
Who the hell do you think you
are, barging into our port?

1399
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:50,500
Who pushed him?

1400
01:42:54,791 --> 01:42:57,291
Who raised his hand on him?

1401
01:42:58,083 --> 01:42:59,708
Was it you?

1402
01:43:00,333 --> 01:43:01,541
You pushed him?

1403
01:43:01,750 --> 01:43:03,208
-Tell me.
-No…

1404
01:43:03,416 --> 01:43:04,833
I didn’t push him.

1405
01:43:04,958 --> 01:43:06,125
Did you push him?

1406
01:43:08,375 --> 01:43:09,375
Tell me!

1407
01:43:10,625 --> 01:43:13,916
How dare you guys push him!

1408
01:43:14,041 --> 01:43:16,000
Pick up the stuff
that old man dropped.

1409
01:43:43,208 --> 01:43:45,000
Cardamom tea, sir.
Especially for you.

1410
01:43:45,208 --> 01:43:46,875
Towel sprayed with cologne, sir.
It will cool you down.

1411
01:43:47,208 --> 01:43:48,333
Who was it?

1412
01:43:48,458 --> 01:43:49,375
Who pushed him?

1413
01:43:49,458 --> 01:43:52,291
You’ve been asking the
same question since you came.

1414
01:43:52,375 --> 01:43:54,291
You seriously don’t think a bunch
of people pushed him, do you?

1415
01:43:54,375 --> 01:43:56,166
Only one guy pushed him
and you hit him long back.

1416
01:43:56,250 --> 01:43:57,500
He’s there.

1417
01:44:03,958 --> 01:44:04,916
Where’s your boss?

1418
01:44:05,083 --> 01:44:08,208
We need to yell his name out and call him.
If you spare us the time that is.

1419
01:44:11,291 --> 01:44:13,041
It can’t get any
clearer than this.

1420
01:44:13,250 --> 01:44:14,875
He is trying to say that...

1421
01:44:15,166 --> 01:44:16,500
your father stabbed
his son-in-law.

1422
01:44:16,708 --> 01:44:18,500
But there was no evidence.
Case is hanging by a weak link now.

1423
01:44:18,625 --> 01:44:20,375
I came and hit you guys.
And there’s no evidence here as well.

1424
01:44:20,458 --> 01:44:22,250
This case will also be weak.

1425
01:44:22,375 --> 01:44:24,375
Let’s not play this
game of tit for tat.

1426
01:44:24,875 --> 01:44:27,875
Let’s sit down and talk it out.

1427
01:44:27,958 --> 01:44:30,416
Sir strongly feels we
shouldn’t resort to violence.

1428
01:44:30,708 --> 01:44:31,708
What do you think?

1429
01:44:31,958 --> 01:44:33,458
What are you looking at? Get up!

1430
01:44:33,541 --> 01:44:35,583
You were quick on your feet a while ago.
Now you’re looking sloppy.

1431
01:44:35,708 --> 01:44:38,500
We’ll be late for our flight. Let’s go.
Brother, you have anything else to ask?

1432
01:44:41,791 --> 01:44:43,291
This is sad!

1433
01:44:43,666 --> 01:44:45,750
Our Prince won't talk...

1434
01:44:46,041 --> 01:44:48,208
This Prince has nothing to say.

1435
01:44:48,583 --> 01:44:49,500
Both of you are unique.

1436
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:57,083
What is that?

1437
01:44:57,666 --> 01:45:01,000
Isn’t this boat
supposed to be on water?

1438
01:45:01,125 --> 01:45:03,250
-It’s a car, man.
-I know that.

1439
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:04,916
I was wondering
what's the name.

1440
01:45:06,833 --> 01:45:09,083
Sounds like a
Rajamouli film title.

1441
01:45:14,041 --> 01:45:17,416
Wow! Amazing contrast, boss!

1442
01:45:18,083 --> 01:45:21,083
The car’s classy look doesn’t
go with your appeal at all.

1443
01:45:21,291 --> 01:45:22,541
Let’s take a selfie.

1444
01:45:29,125 --> 01:45:30,375
Nice umbrella.

1445
01:45:30,791 --> 01:45:33,416
I’ve seen people use it
when it’s sunny or raining.

1446
01:45:33,958 --> 01:45:36,208
But this is the first time,
I saw someone use it to stab.

1447
01:45:37,708 --> 01:45:40,375
I can’t stab
artistically like you.

1448
01:45:41,375 --> 01:45:42,791
I’m rough like that.

1449
01:45:48,208 --> 01:45:49,583
You just got down the car.

1450
01:45:50,291 --> 01:45:52,000
I just got into my character.

1451
01:45:53,958 --> 01:45:55,041
Don’t be shy.

1452
01:45:56,041 --> 01:45:57,083
I’ll see you around.

1453
01:46:03,416 --> 01:46:04,833
Come.
We’ll be late for our flight.

1454
01:46:06,875 --> 01:46:08,500
But I have to admit, boss.

1455
01:46:08,666 --> 01:46:10,000
It’s a great car.

1456
01:46:12,333 --> 01:46:13,541
Hey, wait!

1457
01:46:15,166 --> 01:46:17,583
He warned you in our port.

1458
01:46:17,875 --> 01:46:19,250
I'll kill him.

1459
01:46:21,708 --> 01:46:25,416
They will give us their
company shares very soon.

1460
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:26,916
Where will they go?

1461
01:46:28,166 --> 01:46:29,000
Go.

1462
01:46:30,166 --> 01:46:31,291
Go.

1463
01:46:36,916 --> 01:46:41,000
Don’t ask silly questions like
where and how he got stabbed.

1464
01:46:41,166 --> 01:46:43,416
They’re not like us.
They belong to the elite.

1465
01:46:45,458 --> 01:46:48,875
You’re wearing a cute
skirt after so long.

1466
01:46:48,958 --> 01:46:49,875
Dear…

1467
01:46:51,375 --> 01:46:52,208
Who is he?

1468
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:57,541
Then why is he
getting all touchy?

1469
01:47:01,375 --> 01:47:03,083
You didn’t tell him?

1470
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:04,541
What does she have to tell me?

1471
01:47:04,708 --> 01:47:06,916
Your daughter is not so
interested in the groom.

1472
01:47:07,375 --> 01:47:08,208
So?

1473
01:47:08,291 --> 01:47:11,166
So, we took things
a little too far.

1474
01:47:11,666 --> 01:47:14,541
Oh, that was shocking.
Don’t tell them anything now.

1475
01:47:14,791 --> 01:47:16,375
That is why we didn't tell
you, Dad.

1476
01:47:16,750 --> 01:47:18,125
Why is he calling me "Dad"?

1477
01:47:18,375 --> 01:47:21,125
Ammu’s dad is my dad.
Right, Dad?

1478
01:47:21,333 --> 01:47:23,000
Ammu! Come fast!

1479
01:47:23,208 --> 01:47:25,041
-For now?
-If possible, forever.

1480
01:47:25,166 --> 01:47:26,000
Come on!

1481
01:47:38,041 --> 01:47:39,041
How are you?

1482
01:47:39,833 --> 01:47:42,916
-This is Jubilee Hills Road no. 36, right?
-Yes, sir.

1483
01:47:43,083 --> 01:47:45,500
-What are you doing here then?
-I work here.

1484
01:47:45,625 --> 01:47:46,583
What’s the job?

1485
01:47:46,750 --> 01:47:48,625
They still didn't give
me any designation.

1486
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:50,666
For now, I’m browsing pictures
of girls on the internet.

1487
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,250
What brings you here?

1488
01:47:52,541 --> 01:47:53,916
I’m here to meet
Mr. Ramachandra.

1489
01:47:54,083 --> 01:47:56,208
Whatever it is,
you can tell me, sir.

1490
01:47:56,541 --> 01:47:58,166
I can’t discuss it with a kid.

1491
01:47:58,291 --> 01:48:01,416
Commissioner wanted me to ask if
Mr. Ramachandra needs security.

1492
01:48:01,916 --> 01:48:03,583
He doesn’t need security
while I’m around, sir.

1493
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:05,916
Listen… I’m like a one-man army.

1494
01:48:06,375 --> 01:48:09,083
Who the hell are you to make
decisions about his security?

1495
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:10,875
Come closer.

1496
01:48:11,083 --> 01:48:11,916
What?

1497
01:48:12,333 --> 01:48:13,750
Well...

1498
01:48:14,083 --> 01:48:16,291
I am Mr. Ramachandra’s real son.

1499
01:48:24,208 --> 01:48:25,916
It’s true, sir.
I’m Mr. Ramachandra’s son.

1500
01:48:26,041 --> 01:48:27,250
I swear on you!

1501
01:48:31,041 --> 01:48:32,125
What about him?

1502
01:48:32,625 --> 01:48:34,916
They’ve been assuming he’s
their son for 25 years.

1503
01:48:35,166 --> 01:48:36,041
For 25 years?

1504
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:38,208
-When did you find out?
-Recently.

1505
01:48:38,291 --> 01:48:40,000
-Who told you?
-A nurse told me.

1506
01:48:40,083 --> 01:48:42,500
Nurse and that guy
hiding behind the pillar…

1507
01:48:44,041 --> 01:48:46,916
They replaced him with me,
putting me into a middle-class family.

1508
01:48:47,041 --> 01:48:49,208
And replaced me with him,
making him heir to a rich family.

1509
01:48:49,375 --> 01:48:51,791
-Who told you?
-No, Nurse told me.

1510
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
-When did she tell you?
-Recently.

1511
01:48:54,166 --> 01:48:57,291
-Why didn’t she tell you 25 years ago?
-Because she was in a coma.

1512
01:48:57,458 --> 01:49:00,166
-Why did she tell you now?
-Because she came out of the coma.

1513
01:49:00,541 --> 01:49:02,750
-Did she tell you about it?
-Why would she tell everyone in the world?

1514
01:49:02,833 --> 01:49:04,541
She should have told
Mr. Ramachandra.

1515
01:49:04,666 --> 01:49:06,250
-She was about to tell him.
-Then why didn’t she tell him?

1516
01:49:06,333 --> 01:49:07,916
Because she died before
she could tell him.

1517
01:49:12,208 --> 01:49:13,375
Do you want some tea?

1518
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:15,958
No... I need whiskey.

1519
01:49:16,458 --> 01:49:17,875
I'll drink in the evening
after my working hours.

1520
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:18,958
Okay.

1521
01:49:20,041 --> 01:49:21,458
Bantu, my dear.

1522
01:49:21,791 --> 01:49:24,708
Does anyone else know
about this apart from you?

1523
01:49:25,041 --> 01:49:26,166
No one knows, sir.

1524
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:27,625
I won’t tell anyone either.

1525
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:30,875
I’ll sacrifice.

1526
01:49:31,041 --> 01:49:34,291
If you’re so sacrificing,
why did you come to this house?

1527
01:49:36,916 --> 01:49:38,125
Who else will look after my
house, sir?

1528
01:49:40,375 --> 01:49:42,750
Reddy will kill me.
I need to go to the office urgently.

1529
01:49:42,833 --> 01:49:44,291
I’ll see you in the evening.

1530
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:49,958
What is she doing here?

1531
01:49:51,083 --> 01:49:52,458
His fiancé.

1532
01:49:54,291 --> 01:49:55,583
Why is she kissing you then?

1533
01:49:55,666 --> 01:49:56,875
Because we are in love.

1534
01:49:57,041 --> 01:49:59,000
-Does he know?
-Come on, sir!

1535
01:49:59,083 --> 01:50:00,625
Why would he marry
her if he knew about it?

1536
01:50:00,833 --> 01:50:02,458
Does Ramachandra
know this at least?

1537
01:50:02,625 --> 01:50:04,916
We were going to tell him and
something terrible happened.

1538
01:50:06,708 --> 01:50:08,750
Naughty boy!

1539
01:50:11,791 --> 01:50:12,791
Who is she?

1540
01:50:13,333 --> 01:50:14,666
His nephew.

1541
01:50:14,916 --> 01:50:17,125
-Why is she spanking you?
-I don't know.

1542
01:50:17,250 --> 01:50:19,166
She’s been flirting with me
ever since I joined here.

1543
01:50:19,333 --> 01:50:21,166
Now she is spanking me.

1544
01:50:21,291 --> 01:50:22,208
Nice!

1545
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:24,625
You flirt with all the
girls in this house.

1546
01:50:24,875 --> 01:50:27,041
And he doesn't care about it.

1547
01:50:28,625 --> 01:50:30,291
I can’t see this anymore.

1548
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:31,625
I’ll leave.

1549
01:50:36,625 --> 01:50:41,750
Sir, do you run a background check
on the employees you are hiring?

1550
01:50:42,041 --> 01:50:42,875
We do check.

1551
01:50:43,291 --> 01:50:44,958
Then why did you hire him?

1552
01:50:45,416 --> 01:50:46,750
What are you talking about?

1553
01:50:47,416 --> 01:50:53,000
If there’s anyone in this house with
the common sense and intelligence I do…

1554
01:50:53,125 --> 01:50:53,958
It’s him.

1555
01:50:56,916 --> 01:50:58,166
Very nice!

1556
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,583
Oh, man! I’m done with you.

1557
01:51:03,166 --> 01:51:04,125
Oh, God!

1558
01:51:04,208 --> 01:51:05,500
How did it go, sir?

1559
01:51:05,916 --> 01:51:07,291
It was horrifying.

1560
01:51:07,791 --> 01:51:11,416
We assume all rich
people are intelligent.

1561
01:51:12,041 --> 01:51:13,666
But they’re just lucky.

1562
01:51:19,750 --> 01:51:22,083
After you joined here,
we didn't speak properly.

1563
01:51:22,958 --> 01:51:23,875
They said you went out.

1564
01:51:24,333 --> 01:51:25,875
I was talking to the SP, sir.

1565
01:51:26,166 --> 01:51:29,833
It’s about the attack.
He was asking if you need security.

1566
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,541
We close our doors when
there is heavy breeze.

1567
01:51:38,375 --> 01:51:41,000
But what can we do if
the storm is in our home.

1568
01:51:41,250 --> 01:51:42,750
We have to accept it.

1569
01:51:44,541 --> 01:51:46,333
When we are in tough situations,

1570
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,875
we look to our
family for strength.

1571
01:51:51,333 --> 01:51:53,375
But when that family
is your weakness...

1572
01:51:54,625 --> 01:51:55,750
who do you look to?

1573
01:51:56,250 --> 01:52:00,041
Bantu,
even God needs an offering.

1574
01:52:00,708 --> 01:52:02,833
Even a King needs protection.

1575
01:52:04,333 --> 01:52:08,333
I don't want to tell him
my problems and worry him.

1576
01:52:09,916 --> 01:52:12,458
My son won’t understand
even if I told him.

1577
01:52:13,583 --> 01:52:16,250
There’s no point
in telling them.

1578
01:52:31,458 --> 01:52:34,416
The greatest battles are
fought with the closest people.

1579
01:52:39,375 --> 01:52:40,416
What did my son-in-law say?

1580
01:52:40,875 --> 01:52:42,333
He said a lot.

1581
01:52:43,708 --> 01:52:46,041
Is he upset about the
differences with my daughter?

1582
01:52:47,583 --> 01:52:49,083
Of course, he would be.

1583
01:52:49,375 --> 01:52:51,500
It’s been seven years since
they had a proper conversation.

1584
01:52:52,458 --> 01:52:54,416
Did he tell you anything else?

1585
01:52:55,291 --> 01:52:56,458
He didn’t tell me anything, sir.

1586
01:52:56,833 --> 01:52:58,666
-But you just did.
-Oh no!

1587
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,166
You can’t keep a secret, right?

1588
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:02,333
What?

1589
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,083
I won’t live for another
100 years to be patient.

1590
01:53:05,708 --> 01:53:07,208
I need to know
everything immediately.

1591
01:53:07,875 --> 01:53:09,375
-Okay.
-So, what did he say?

1592
01:53:10,041 --> 01:53:12,750
-He said something about his son.
-Is he feeling bad?

1593
01:53:15,833 --> 01:53:17,166
He is a strange guy.

1594
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:19,500
Sit, sit.

1595
01:53:20,375 --> 01:53:22,375
No one knows what’s
in his heart.

1596
01:53:23,083 --> 01:53:26,291
I want to see him burst out in
anger, I’ll die a happy man.

1597
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:30,083
I'll help you!
You don’t need to die for it.

1598
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,708
You don't go to office.

1599
01:53:36,916 --> 01:53:39,166
You are sitting
outside and smoking.

1600
01:53:39,333 --> 01:53:41,958
They are very innocent.
This is wrong.

1601
01:53:42,291 --> 01:53:44,333
I am the owner! My wish!

1602
01:53:45,791 --> 01:53:48,708
-Get out! Get out!
-Rascal!

1603
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:53,041
He’s got something, man.

1604
01:53:53,875 --> 01:53:55,750
Grandpa is giving him
way too much lenience.

1605
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,958
Ramachandra treats him
like a family member.

1606
01:53:58,458 --> 01:54:00,041
We should be friends with him.

1607
01:54:00,208 --> 01:54:02,041
Why do you want
to mess things up?

1608
01:54:02,458 --> 01:54:05,083
One and a half lakh
expenditure every day?

1609
01:54:10,916 --> 01:54:12,666
We’re discussing accounts here
and why are you hitting them?

1610
01:54:12,791 --> 01:54:14,166
Because they hit me.

1611
01:54:14,291 --> 01:54:16,708
-Why did they hit you?
-Because they stole one lakh.

1612
01:54:17,541 --> 01:54:18,541
Why did they hit you only?

1613
01:54:18,625 --> 01:54:20,458
Because they gave me share.

1614
01:54:22,083 --> 01:54:23,208
Give me that stick.

1615
01:54:23,458 --> 01:54:24,666
For what?

1616
01:54:24,833 --> 01:54:27,291
Because I have to hit them.

1617
01:54:27,375 --> 01:54:29,166
Uncle! Uncle! No!

1618
01:54:31,125 --> 01:54:33,583
You don’t worry.
I’ll go get sister.

1619
01:54:34,708 --> 01:54:36,166
What’s going on, Sita?
What happened?

1620
01:54:36,291 --> 01:54:38,958
Stop running and let him hit you...
he will be satisfied.

1621
01:54:39,041 --> 01:54:41,208
Yasu, uncle is beating
me just because he said.

1622
01:54:41,291 --> 01:54:43,333
What’s wrong, Dad?
Why are you hitting him?

1623
01:54:43,416 --> 01:54:45,500
After finding out how much
money he’s looting every day…

1624
01:54:45,875 --> 01:54:47,583
what did you expect from me?

1625
01:54:48,208 --> 01:54:49,291
Who told you?

1626
01:54:49,375 --> 01:54:50,208
He told me.

1627
01:54:50,291 --> 01:54:51,875
How do you know if it's true?

1628
01:54:52,083 --> 01:54:53,500
He will tell me
only if it’s true.

1629
01:54:54,666 --> 01:54:55,500
Oh, really?

1630
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:57,666
You speak the truth, right?

1631
01:54:58,166 --> 01:54:59,000
Tell me.

1632
01:55:01,166 --> 01:55:03,166
Why will he loot our money?

1633
01:55:03,541 --> 01:55:05,791
We are paying him ten
lakhs every month.

1634
01:55:06,750 --> 01:55:09,000
He bets a million
rupees on a poker table.

1635
01:55:09,291 --> 01:55:10,208
He’s a big player.

1636
01:55:10,416 --> 01:55:12,083
Dad, you gamble?

1637
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,625
Only on the weekends.

1638
01:55:15,791 --> 01:55:17,416
That’s it. Yeah.

1639
01:55:17,958 --> 01:55:20,125
He talks to Priya
on the weekdays.

1640
01:55:21,583 --> 01:55:23,583
-Who’s Priya?
-How would I know?

1641
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:25,333
Not everything you say is true.

1642
01:55:25,458 --> 01:55:28,083
You have a message from Priya in
the mobile you threw on the floor.

1643
01:55:29,916 --> 01:55:31,333
It reads, "Call me."

1644
01:55:33,083 --> 01:55:34,916
What’s the big deal?
She just asked me to call back.

1645
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:38,208
-There is no controversy here.
-Actually, she called you baby in the end.

1646
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:44,208
She also sent a heart emoticon.
In red.

1647
01:55:45,416 --> 01:55:47,250
Don’t look, sir.
Her pictures are on it.

1648
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:48,333
Really?

1649
01:55:55,875 --> 01:55:57,125
Why are you hitting me
when it’s his fault?

1650
01:55:57,333 --> 01:55:58,458
Where were you when
all this was happening?

1651
01:55:58,625 --> 01:56:00,625
What do you expect me to do?
Find a girl for myself?

1652
01:56:01,666 --> 01:56:03,875
Hey! When will you women change?

1653
01:56:04,125 --> 01:56:06,333
You hit your brothers just because
you can't slap your husbands.

1654
01:56:06,458 --> 01:56:08,500
They’re outdated.
They will never change.

1655
01:56:08,583 --> 01:56:13,083
Why is he running away if
Bantu wasn’t telling the truth?

1656
01:56:14,166 --> 01:56:16,500
Alright then. I’ll hear you out.

1657
01:56:16,791 --> 01:56:18,000
Tell about me.

1658
01:56:18,333 --> 01:56:19,791
Isn’t that too
much for the day?

1659
01:56:20,291 --> 01:56:21,208
You come with me.

1660
01:56:21,416 --> 01:56:22,375
Father!

1661
01:56:24,458 --> 01:56:25,541
You tell me.

1662
01:56:31,375 --> 01:56:32,875
You don’t get along
with your husband.

1663
01:56:35,708 --> 01:56:37,625
Bantu! Come with me.

1664
01:56:37,708 --> 01:56:38,666
Dad!

1665
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:40,583
How do you know?

1666
01:56:40,875 --> 01:56:43,000
You shut your room door
the first time I was here.

1667
01:56:44,250 --> 01:56:45,458
I knew it right away.

1668
01:56:47,625 --> 01:56:50,041
Wife and husband go
through a lot of stuff.

1669
01:56:50,333 --> 01:56:52,458
They will shut and open
doors as they please.

1670
01:56:53,625 --> 01:56:55,625
If a newlywed couple
closes the door…

1671
01:56:55,791 --> 01:56:57,750
it means they have something
personal to talk about.

1672
01:56:58,791 --> 01:57:01,083
But if they still shut
the door after 25 years…

1673
01:57:02,541 --> 01:57:05,583
It means they don’t want the world
to know they’re not on talking terms.

1674
01:57:07,375 --> 01:57:10,375
He comes home at six o'clock,
no matter how busy he is.

1675
01:57:11,208 --> 01:57:14,500
So, he’s implying that his life
revolves around family and work only.

1676
01:57:15,166 --> 01:57:17,625
And when a man is trying so
hard, it means that…

1677
01:57:18,750 --> 01:57:20,500
he did something
wrong in the past.

1678
01:57:20,750 --> 01:57:22,041
What is it?

1679
01:57:34,875 --> 01:57:37,291
She was his secretary
seven years ago.

1680
01:57:37,708 --> 01:57:39,458
She resigned only
after a month’s duty.

1681
01:57:41,708 --> 01:57:43,166
Back then…

1682
01:57:47,333 --> 01:57:49,125
The sad part is everyone
knew about this.

1683
01:57:50,041 --> 01:57:52,041
But everyone pretends
like it’s nothing.

1684
01:57:53,750 --> 01:57:55,125
Including your father.

1685
01:58:02,333 --> 01:58:05,291
Do you think telling the
truth makes you great?

1686
01:58:06,291 --> 01:58:08,083
When kids don't eat food...

1687
01:58:08,750 --> 01:58:11,125
their mother will tell
them a scary story.

1688
01:58:11,541 --> 01:58:12,791
Is that wrong on her part?

1689
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:14,916
Try and love someone.

1690
01:58:15,916 --> 01:58:17,916
You will know what
a lie is worth.

1691
01:58:19,291 --> 01:58:22,583
That mother also tells her grown up kid
that he’ll fall sick if he doesn’t eat.

1692
01:58:23,916 --> 01:58:25,416
She won't lie to him.

1693
01:58:26,666 --> 01:58:29,208
You’ll know what a lie is worth
when you love someone. I get it.

1694
01:58:29,458 --> 01:58:32,958
But you’ll know how strong your love
is, only when you tell the truth.

1695
01:58:35,250 --> 01:58:36,625
It might be tough.

1696
01:58:38,583 --> 01:58:42,041
But a relationship built on
truth stays solid as a rock, sir.

1697
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:49,458
It’s five o'clock.
Time for me to go off duty.

1698
01:58:49,750 --> 01:58:52,500
Does this mark the end of this episode?
Or is it going to be continued tomorrow?

1699
01:58:54,041 --> 01:58:55,041
Go!

1700
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,625
She is not educated like you...

1701
01:59:27,666 --> 01:59:30,541
Or beautiful like you.

1702
01:59:33,125 --> 01:59:36,708
Or superior to you in any way.

1703
01:59:37,250 --> 01:59:39,666
Maybe that is why I liked her...

1704
01:59:40,375 --> 01:59:45,791
because of my
inferiority complex.

1705
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:53,041
Is it my fault that
I tried to be my best?

1706
01:59:54,500 --> 01:59:56,166
Is that why you are hurting me?

1707
02:00:00,166 --> 02:00:05,041
Have I ever compared
myself to her?

1708
02:00:07,333 --> 02:00:09,083
But, dear...
don’t I deserve a sorry?

1709
02:00:16,833 --> 02:00:20,041
Earlier, you would try to prove that
you are the perfect match for me.

1710
02:00:21,125 --> 02:00:23,583
Now you are just trying to prove
you’re not doing anything wrong.

1711
02:00:23,666 --> 02:00:24,916
Why, Ramu?

1712
02:00:26,041 --> 02:00:26,916
Why?

1713
02:00:27,291 --> 02:00:29,125
Why do you have to
prove anything to me?

1714
02:00:31,083 --> 02:00:32,291
Be yourself.

1715
02:00:34,416 --> 02:00:35,833
Just be your true self.

1716
02:00:37,416 --> 02:00:38,791
There’s nothing I’d want more.

1717
02:00:42,958 --> 02:00:43,791
Hey!

1718
02:00:45,291 --> 02:00:47,916
I was scared, Yasu...

1719
02:00:49,583 --> 02:00:52,833
to look into your
eyes and talk to you.

1720
02:00:53,375 --> 02:00:54,708
I was scared...

1721
02:00:54,833 --> 02:00:56,333
for the things I've done.

1722
02:00:58,125 --> 02:00:59,500
How do I make it up to you?

1723
02:01:26,333 --> 02:01:28,208
Why isn’t my daughter reacting?

1724
02:01:28,416 --> 02:01:30,166
Don’t ruin the moment
with your curiosity.

1725
02:01:30,291 --> 02:01:31,583
Give them some time.

1726
02:01:54,208 --> 02:01:56,708
They are hugging each other.

1727
02:01:58,750 --> 02:02:01,458
Then close your eyes
and let me have my meal.

1728
02:02:06,375 --> 02:02:08,166
Shall I tell you
something mind blowing?

1729
02:02:09,250 --> 02:02:11,416
ARK brought Ramachandra
into this house.

1730
02:02:12,041 --> 02:02:14,125
He made him the clerk
and soon the CEO.

1731
02:02:14,375 --> 02:02:16,708
Finally made him his son-in-law,
only for him to torture us ever since.

1732
02:02:16,791 --> 02:02:18,958
He brought home
this new guy now.

1733
02:02:19,208 --> 02:02:22,666
And this guy has only
doubled the torture.

1734
02:02:23,250 --> 02:02:26,083
That old man brings someone home and
that guy gets us into trouble every time.

1735
02:02:27,041 --> 02:02:29,375
What if we brought someone home?

1736
02:02:30,291 --> 02:02:32,166
That guy will be
on our side then.

1737
02:02:32,500 --> 02:02:36,666
We can loot a huge
sum of amount.

1738
02:02:36,791 --> 02:02:38,250
But who do we call?

1739
02:02:40,208 --> 02:02:41,416
Should we call Sudarshan?

1740
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:43,291
She can handle him easily.

1741
02:02:43,833 --> 02:02:47,041
He's a pilot... another
guy planned this meeting.

1742
02:02:47,416 --> 02:02:48,583
He is Paidithalli.

1743
02:02:48,666 --> 02:02:51,500
He alone can handle
all of them easily.

1744
02:03:08,958 --> 02:03:11,875
Mr. Ramachandra already said
we don’t want this deal, right?

1745
02:03:12,250 --> 02:03:13,916
His son was looking hesitant.

1746
02:03:14,375 --> 02:03:15,500
So, he had to do it
out of courtesy.

1747
02:03:15,666 --> 02:03:17,500
But he didn’t completely
want to reject the deal.

1748
02:03:17,666 --> 02:03:20,208
So, I called him
back to discuss it.

1749
02:03:20,625 --> 02:03:22,500
Let’s see what
they’ve got to offer.

1750
02:03:22,666 --> 02:03:27,375
Besides,
if he goes on rejecting everyone…

1751
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:28,791
You know...

1752
02:03:30,916 --> 02:03:32,958
Did they send you to say "No"?

1753
02:03:34,208 --> 02:03:36,458
No matter what,
I will make sure they say "Yes."

1754
02:03:37,750 --> 02:03:40,166
She can’t do it alone.
I have to go.

1755
02:03:43,958 --> 02:03:44,833
You sit down.

1756
02:03:45,541 --> 02:03:47,958
-Yasu, I have to go.
-I don’t care.

1757
02:03:48,291 --> 02:03:50,208
You are important to me.
Okay? Sit down.

1758
02:03:50,333 --> 02:03:53,041
Wives often push their husbands
to earn more, son-in-law.

1759
02:03:53,166 --> 02:03:55,541
A wife who asks her husband
to relax is a rare sight.

1760
02:03:58,416 --> 02:04:01,083
I know who can deal with them.

1761
02:04:13,375 --> 02:04:15,166
Good sign! Hold this, sister.

1762
02:04:15,333 --> 02:04:16,916
I didn't zip up.

1763
02:04:20,875 --> 02:04:21,916
Put it on me.

1764
02:04:28,041 --> 02:04:29,333
Suit looks good.

1765
02:04:30,416 --> 02:04:32,125
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?

1766
02:04:32,416 --> 02:04:34,083
Why are you all decked up?

1767
02:04:34,166 --> 02:04:35,291
Relax!

1768
02:04:38,375 --> 02:04:40,208
I got it.

1769
02:04:48,291 --> 02:04:50,416
We have made all the
arrangements to buy shares.

1770
02:04:56,750 --> 02:04:57,916
Who are you?

1771
02:05:02,625 --> 02:05:05,333
<i>The savior is here</i>

1772
02:05:05,583 --> 02:05:08,541
<i>He brought showers to the barren land</i>

1773
02:05:09,583 --> 02:05:11,916
<i>The savior does what he does best</i>

1774
02:05:12,291 --> 02:05:15,291
<i>He has given us the hope of new beginnings</i>

1775
02:05:19,666 --> 02:05:22,000
<i>The savior is here</i>

1776
02:05:22,375 --> 02:05:25,541
<i>He brought showers to the barren land</i>

1777
02:05:27,333 --> 02:05:29,625
He’s at the port, the board
meeting and basically everywhere.

1778
02:05:46,416 --> 02:05:48,291
Madam is like your
sir’s speaker.

1779
02:05:48,541 --> 02:05:49,833
Is he like her mic?

1780
02:05:49,958 --> 02:05:52,250
This is way too many people for a meeting.
I want to hear from only one of you.

1781
02:05:57,291 --> 02:05:59,500
<i>Why don't you stay?</i>

1782
02:06:01,375 --> 02:06:04,083
<i>This heart belongs to you</i>

1783
02:06:05,416 --> 02:06:07,833
<i>Why don't you hug me tight?</i>

1784
02:06:09,458 --> 02:06:12,000
<i>Hold me closer to your heart</i>

1785
02:06:12,083 --> 02:06:15,166
Is he playing the song for my nephew? Or
is he making the most of this situation?

1786
02:06:15,250 --> 02:06:20,833
<i>I wonder if the word "beauty"</i>
<i>Was coined after you</i>

1787
02:06:20,958 --> 02:06:28,916
<i>I'm too shy to ask you for a hug</i>

1788
02:06:29,083 --> 02:06:31,791
<i>Why don't you stay?</i>

1789
02:06:33,166 --> 02:06:35,916
Now that she has left…
we’ll have to see what he can do.

1790
02:06:37,458 --> 02:06:39,416
I will show you
what I’m made of.

1791
02:06:41,125 --> 02:06:46,041
<i>I'll make you go crazy</i>

1792
02:06:46,166 --> 02:06:51,333
<i>I'll make you cheer</i>
<i>for every moment</i>

1793
02:06:51,416 --> 02:06:56,291
<i>I'll make you go crazy</i>

1794
02:06:56,541 --> 02:07:01,750
<i>I'll make you cheer for every moment</i>

1795
02:07:04,791 --> 02:07:07,541
It’s time for you to play
a Pawan Kalyan track.

1796
02:07:07,750 --> 02:07:09,458
Situation doesn’t demand
it, Mr. Sitaram.

1797
02:07:09,666 --> 02:07:11,958
His songs don’t need a situation.
We’re demanding it, right?

1798
02:07:12,416 --> 02:07:13,541
Hey!

1799
02:07:15,666 --> 02:07:18,500
Welcome to Vividha
Bharathi’s special telecast.

1800
02:07:18,916 --> 02:07:22,250
Here's a request of Sitaram,
brother-in-law of Kasiram from Kakinada.

1801
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:24,500
A song from
"Gabbar Singh."

1802
02:07:26,750 --> 02:07:28,416
<i>What are you guys looking at me for?</i>

1803
02:07:28,625 --> 02:07:30,291
<i>Start playing the drums</i>

1804
02:07:32,125 --> 02:07:33,125
<i>That's right!</i>

1805
02:07:39,833 --> 02:07:44,833
<i>Hey, girl... a life without you is</i>
<i>Like a spinning top without a thread</i>

1806
02:07:49,958 --> 02:07:55,541
<i>Hey, girl... a life without you is</i>
<i>Like a cracker slipped into water</i>

1807
02:08:05,875 --> 02:08:07,500
What was that?

1808
02:08:07,625 --> 02:08:09,375
Get down. Idiot!

1809
02:08:09,541 --> 02:08:11,250
Is this a board room or a ball room?

1810
02:08:29,250 --> 02:08:31,208
Hey!
Do you know who signed that?

1811
02:08:32,208 --> 02:08:34,000
Do you know him? Tell me!

1812
02:08:57,416 --> 02:08:59,083
Your song?

1813
02:08:59,375 --> 02:09:01,375
It’s you? You?

1814
02:09:02,791 --> 02:09:04,083
Mine?

1815
02:09:04,541 --> 02:09:06,250
It's mine.

1816
02:09:06,958 --> 02:09:09,958
We covered the megastar’s song as well.

1817
02:09:10,750 --> 02:09:13,541
His timing is amazing.

1818
02:09:14,583 --> 02:09:15,958
When will they change?

1819
02:09:16,208 --> 02:09:18,500
Why is everyone running
away when he hit one person?

1820
02:09:18,666 --> 02:09:19,541
Shall we go?

1821
02:09:19,625 --> 02:09:22,416
I feel something is
missing, Bantu.

1822
02:09:23,625 --> 02:09:25,000
Incomplete?

1823
02:09:25,333 --> 02:09:27,541
But I’ve played such a
versatile compilation.

1824
02:09:28,375 --> 02:09:29,625
Did you miss the dialogue?

1825
02:09:34,791 --> 02:09:37,333
Father is unwell.
Mother can’t go to work.

1826
02:09:37,750 --> 02:09:40,083
Grandpa is getting older...
Grandson is young.

1827
02:09:40,625 --> 02:09:43,000
Just because you have
cars and the roads are empty...

1828
02:09:43,083 --> 02:09:44,666
don’t come here
whenever you want.

1829
02:09:47,625 --> 02:09:49,333
They have a brother.

1830
02:09:50,500 --> 02:09:52,375
He will stand in your way.

1831
02:09:53,916 --> 02:09:54,958
What?

1832
02:09:57,500 --> 02:10:00,500
A whistle isn’t enough.
We need blasting background music.

1833
02:10:00,750 --> 02:10:03,375
Slow motion… things flying in the air…
we need lot of special effects to it.

1834
02:10:03,750 --> 02:10:05,375
I’ll plan it... let's go.

1835
02:10:18,083 --> 02:10:18,958
What happened?

1836
02:10:19,541 --> 02:10:21,583
Son-in-law,
Bantu hit this one out of the park.

1837
02:10:25,916 --> 02:10:28,625
Dear,
I’m throwing a party tonight.

1838
02:10:28,791 --> 02:10:29,750
And I’m going to drink.

1839
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:42,750
Brother, stop it.

1840
02:10:43,291 --> 02:10:46,125
Do you have any desi music
instead of this English music?

1841
02:10:49,416 --> 02:10:51,583
Wow! That sounds great.

1842
02:10:52,041 --> 02:10:53,750
Whom do we talk about?

1843
02:10:53,916 --> 02:10:56,541
Reddy? His life is boring.

1844
02:10:56,875 --> 02:11:00,083
Sekhar? No way.

1845
02:11:00,458 --> 02:11:03,083
I'll tell about myself.

1846
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:07,208
<i>Bantu was a well-known dude in his area</i>

1847
02:11:07,375 --> 02:11:11,000
<i>He had a bunch of guys</i>
<i>Follow him everywhere</i>

1848
02:11:11,166 --> 02:11:14,833
<i>They got on their bikes</i>
<i>One night for alcohol</i>

1849
02:11:14,958 --> 02:11:18,500
<i>They crashed every store for alcohol</i>

1850
02:11:18,791 --> 02:11:22,375
<i>There she was,</i>
<i>Shining like a beer in silk a sari</i>

1851
02:11:22,541 --> 02:11:26,458
<i>Tempting me like a packet of hot biryani</i>

1852
02:11:26,583 --> 02:11:30,416
<i>Standing on the terrace,</i>
<i>She was like the moon</i>

1853
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:34,125
<i>Her beauty got me high,</i>
<i>Without having to booze</i>

1854
02:11:34,250 --> 02:11:38,000
<i>While she was hopping</i>
<i>Around like a deer</i>

1855
02:11:38,083 --> 02:11:41,958
<i>Her earring fell</i>
<i>And it stuck my heart</i>

1856
02:11:43,500 --> 02:11:47,166
<i>Oh, boy! She blew my mind</i>

1857
02:11:47,333 --> 02:11:50,916
<i>Oh, boy! She blew my heart</i>

1858
02:11:51,166 --> 02:11:54,916
<i>Oh, boy! She blew my mind</i>

1859
02:11:55,041 --> 02:11:58,458
<i>Oh, boy! She blew my heart</i>

1860
02:11:58,916 --> 02:12:02,625
<i>Oh, boy! She blew my mind</i>

1861
02:12:02,791 --> 02:12:06,375
<i>Oh, boy! She blew my heart</i>

1862
02:12:37,375 --> 02:12:41,000
<i>Oh, boy! She blew my mind</i>

1863
02:12:41,166 --> 02:12:44,708
<i>Oh, boy! She blew my heart</i>

1864
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:48,666
<i>Oh, boy! She blew my mind</i>

1865
02:12:48,833 --> 02:12:52,708
<i>Oh, boy! She blew my heart</i>

1866
02:13:23,208 --> 02:13:27,500
<i>Every time I eat betel leaf,</i>
<i>I think of your scent</i>

1867
02:13:27,583 --> 02:13:30,833
<i>Your red blushing cheeks</i>
<i>Take over my mind</i>

1868
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:35,166
<i>Every time I wear a floral shirt,</i>
<i>You bloom like a button</i>

1869
02:13:35,250 --> 02:13:38,583
<i>You barge into my heart</i>
<i>And create chaos inside</i>

1870
02:13:38,791 --> 02:13:42,500
<i>When the bulb in front of my house</i>
<i>flickers</i>

1871
02:13:42,916 --> 02:13:46,291
<i>It seems like you’re winking at me</i>
<i>Naughtily</i>

1872
02:13:46,666 --> 02:13:50,166
<i>When my drapes are stuck in the door hinge</i>

1873
02:13:50,375 --> 02:13:53,916
<i>It seems like you’re pulling them</i>
<i>And it gives me goosebumps</i>

1874
02:14:09,708 --> 02:14:13,541
<i>Like a snake swaying to</i>
<i>The snake charmer’s tune</i>

1875
02:14:13,666 --> 02:14:17,416
<i>I follow your track as</i>
<i>Your anklets begin to clink</i>

1876
02:14:17,541 --> 02:14:21,250
<i>You go around like you don’t care, sweetie</i>

1877
02:14:21,416 --> 02:14:25,541
<i>You hide and peep from a corner</i>

1878
02:14:26,791 --> 02:14:30,500
<i>Oh boy! She blew my mind</i>

1879
02:14:30,666 --> 02:14:34,375
<i>Oh boy! She blew my heart</i>

1880
02:14:34,458 --> 02:14:37,958
<i>Oh boy! She blew my mind</i>

1881
02:14:38,333 --> 02:14:41,875
<i>Oh boy! She blew my heart</i>

1882
02:14:42,208 --> 02:14:45,833
<i>Oh boy! She blew my mind</i>

1883
02:14:46,041 --> 02:14:49,750
<i>Oh boy! She blew my heart</i>

1884
02:14:49,875 --> 02:14:53,541
<i>Oh boy! She blew my mind</i>

1885
02:14:53,750 --> 02:14:57,666
<i>Oh boy! She blew my heart</i>

1886
02:15:19,125 --> 02:15:20,750
This house provided us a living.

1887
02:15:21,416 --> 02:15:23,291
It fed us through
all these years.

1888
02:15:24,458 --> 02:15:26,500
And when they welcomed you
to this house with open arms…

1889
02:15:26,625 --> 02:15:27,875
what did you do?

1890
02:15:28,541 --> 02:15:30,125
You got into a
brawl with a rowdy.

1891
02:15:31,625 --> 02:15:33,041
You kidnapped a little kid.

1892
02:15:33,208 --> 02:15:34,791
You blackmailed a millionaire.

1893
02:15:34,875 --> 02:15:36,750
You also started flirting with
their future daughter-in-law.

1894
02:15:41,500 --> 02:15:45,250
Someone like you don’t
deserve a place in any house.

1895
02:15:47,291 --> 02:15:48,125
Get out.

1896
02:15:53,416 --> 02:15:54,958
Stop calling me Valmiki.

1897
02:15:55,291 --> 02:15:56,791
Haven’t I taught you better?

1898
02:15:57,083 --> 02:16:00,291
I’m your dad! So, call me that.

1899
02:16:01,666 --> 02:16:03,083
Get out.

1900
02:16:18,750 --> 02:16:21,875
You must be tired of telling the
truth ever since you were a kid.

1901
02:16:23,250 --> 02:16:24,583
Take a break.

1902
02:16:26,375 --> 02:16:30,541
When you were born, it only took me
25 minutes to bring you downstairs.

1903
02:16:31,541 --> 02:16:36,000
But it took you 25 years
to climb back to the top.

1904
02:16:38,458 --> 02:16:40,583
This time I am pushing you.

1905
02:16:41,375 --> 02:16:43,416
There’s no way you can climb back up.
Impossible!

1906
02:16:49,125 --> 02:16:51,000
Yes, ma’am… I am coming.

1907
02:16:53,541 --> 02:16:55,541
VAIKUNTHAPURAM.

1908
02:17:00,125 --> 02:17:02,791
Thank God. It’s over.

1909
02:17:08,750 --> 02:17:10,458
Why are you sad, Bantu?

1910
02:17:11,541 --> 02:17:14,125
This is what we’ve been
trying to tell them.

1911
02:17:14,833 --> 02:17:17,041
Even I’ve been trying
to tell you something.

1912
02:17:35,458 --> 02:17:37,458
Did you tell your real
parents the truth?

1913
02:17:38,875 --> 02:17:40,000
I’ll never tell them.

1914
02:17:43,458 --> 02:17:47,375
Then there is no point
in going to that house.

1915
02:17:48,500 --> 02:17:50,708
I don't get it.

1916
02:17:53,041 --> 02:17:55,166
Did I leave all my problems?

1917
02:17:56,875 --> 02:18:00,291
It feels like I left a blank
answer sheet in the examination hall.

1918
02:18:05,791 --> 02:18:07,208
Those papers state that half of
your company's share belongs to me.

1919
02:18:07,750 --> 02:18:10,166
I want you both to
sign on the papers

1920
02:18:10,750 --> 02:18:13,083
and send them to my
farmhouse with your son.

1921
02:18:13,583 --> 02:18:17,125
If you don’t, I’ll send your
niece’s dead body in an hour.

1922
02:18:17,208 --> 02:18:21,583
If you don’t seek the police,
it will just be a kidnap.

1923
02:18:21,875 --> 02:18:23,208
But if you do...

1924
02:18:23,291 --> 02:18:24,416
it will end up being a murder.

1925
02:18:25,708 --> 02:18:26,666
Get it?

1926
02:18:48,875 --> 02:18:50,000
Brother-in-law…

1927
02:18:54,041 --> 02:18:54,958
Get up.

1928
02:18:56,250 --> 02:18:57,375
Brother-in-law...

1929
02:18:57,500 --> 02:19:01,083
It was thrilling to loot someone’s
money without their notice.

1930
02:19:01,541 --> 02:19:05,333
But I didn’t know it’d be so burdening
if they gave up the money willingly.

1931
02:19:06,375 --> 02:19:07,708
I can’t carry it around.

1932
02:19:08,416 --> 02:19:10,250
I don’t know how to repay you.

1933
02:19:11,458 --> 02:19:13,791
I can’t believe you gave up
your wealth for my daughter.

1934
02:19:14,375 --> 02:19:16,250
She grew up right in
front of my eyes, Kasi.

1935
02:19:16,875 --> 02:19:18,083
Isn’t she my daughter as well?

1936
02:19:20,208 --> 02:19:21,708
Calm down, Kasi.

1937
02:19:27,083 --> 02:19:29,416
Raj… Raj… I don’t
want you to go.

1938
02:19:29,708 --> 02:19:31,333
Your family has already
done a lot for us.

1939
02:19:31,625 --> 02:19:34,875
I can’t forgive myself if
anything happened to you.

1940
02:19:35,083 --> 02:19:37,708
-I will only go… give it to me.
-Uncle, he asked me to get it.

1941
02:19:37,875 --> 02:19:40,416
Come on. Give me the money.
It’s okay. I will convince them.

1942
02:19:40,500 --> 02:19:43,166
He’s right, sir.
Let him fight for his daughter.

1943
02:19:43,541 --> 02:19:44,458
You can’t do it.

1944
02:19:44,541 --> 02:19:45,541
Come here.

1945
02:19:46,125 --> 02:19:47,875
Sir, tell him.

1946
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,833
Raj is innocent...
Paidithalli is a monster.

1947
02:19:50,125 --> 02:19:52,041
He doesn’t know anything
about the outside world.

1948
02:19:52,125 --> 02:19:53,416
I know how the world works.

1949
02:19:54,291 --> 02:19:56,333
You guys don’t know me at all.
None of you do.

1950
02:20:00,750 --> 02:20:02,916
I smoke a cigarette and
throw it in uncle’s balcony.

1951
02:20:03,041 --> 02:20:03,875
Every day!

1952
02:20:08,375 --> 02:20:10,750
I have a few drinks and grow
money plants in those bottles.

1953
02:20:10,875 --> 02:20:12,583
Did you know that?
No, you don’t!

1954
02:20:17,916 --> 02:20:20,208
I like her.

1955
02:20:23,708 --> 02:20:25,833
I like Nandu.
You don’t know that.

1956
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,041
I don’t want to get married to Amulya.
You don’t know that.

1957
02:20:30,375 --> 02:20:31,583
None of you even
bothered to ask.

1958
02:20:31,666 --> 02:20:33,125
And no one’s ready to listen.

1959
02:20:34,416 --> 02:20:37,083
You always complained about me
not expressing myself, right?

1960
02:20:40,791 --> 02:20:42,708
Here I am, expressing myself.
Hear me out.

1961
02:20:46,250 --> 02:20:47,541
It’s my mother’s wealth.

1962
02:20:48,250 --> 02:20:49,375
And she’s my girl.

1963
02:20:49,875 --> 02:20:51,041
I only have to go.

1964
02:20:51,666 --> 02:20:52,583
Son…

1965
02:20:53,333 --> 02:20:55,125
You’d be humiliated if I hit
you, uncle.

1966
02:21:04,875 --> 02:21:07,125
Bantu...
Kasiram's daughter is kidnapped.

1967
02:21:07,333 --> 02:21:08,750
They are demanding
company shares.

1968
02:21:08,833 --> 02:21:10,666
They are asking for Raju.

1969
02:21:11,291 --> 02:21:12,708
They'll kill him.

1970
02:21:12,791 --> 02:21:15,375
-Please do something.
-I've no connection with that house.

1971
02:21:15,458 --> 02:21:16,666
Bantu! listen to me.

1972
02:21:32,083 --> 02:21:34,166
I thought you’re my savior.
But you’re also hitting me.

1973
02:21:34,291 --> 02:21:35,833
I’ve had a bad day so far.

1974
02:21:36,125 --> 02:21:37,125
What happened?

1975
02:21:38,250 --> 02:21:41,000
When my brother-in-law heard the good
news about Bantu getting kicked out…

1976
02:21:42,208 --> 02:21:43,958
he decided to settle two things.

1977
02:21:44,500 --> 02:21:46,583
Mr. Chalapathi Rao didn't
agree to sell his farm.

1978
02:21:46,916 --> 02:21:48,291
He decided to threaten him.

1979
02:21:49,083 --> 02:21:50,750
He wanted to kidnap your girl

1980
02:21:51,041 --> 02:21:52,541
and manipulate you
for the share.

1981
02:21:53,083 --> 02:21:54,375
My nephew was drinking.

1982
02:21:54,791 --> 02:21:56,500
Few goons were playing
the game, "Tiger and the Goat."

1983
02:21:56,958 --> 02:21:59,416
We were going to receive 500
crores worth shares in 15 minutes.

1984
02:21:59,750 --> 02:22:04,333
Our men were looking at the road,
hoping this would change their lives.

1985
02:22:05,708 --> 02:22:07,375
Brother-in-law was
preparing barbecue.

1986
02:22:07,958 --> 02:22:10,083
Everything was going
to plan until then.

1987
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:14,583
But at the same time…
a tiger has arrived.

1988
02:22:15,708 --> 02:22:17,000
The goat died.

1989
02:22:17,083 --> 02:22:21,375
<i>He's a miracle worker</i>

1990
02:22:21,541 --> 02:22:25,541
<i>He is strong willed</i>

1991
02:22:26,208 --> 02:22:34,125
<i>He sorts things around the city</i>

1992
02:22:34,833 --> 02:22:38,958
<i>He doesn't give up no matter what</i>

1993
02:22:56,875 --> 02:23:01,500
<i>He pulled the bull's horns</i>
<i>And played a tune with them</i>

1994
02:23:01,583 --> 02:23:09,541
<i>He pulled the bull's horns</i>
<i>And played a tune with them</i>

1995
02:23:14,958 --> 02:23:18,791
<i>When everyone was terrified of the demon</i>

1996
02:23:18,875 --> 02:23:23,208
<i>Like banyan's benches</i>

1997
02:23:23,458 --> 02:23:27,541
<i>He challenged the devil for a face off</i>

1998
02:23:37,208 --> 02:23:41,583
<i>When there was a monster</i>

1999
02:23:41,666 --> 02:23:45,791
<i>At the carnival teasing girls…</i>

2000
02:23:46,125 --> 02:23:53,000
<i>He set his ways straight</i>

2001
02:23:53,083 --> 02:23:56,375
<i>for a lifetime</i>

2002
02:24:01,541 --> 02:24:02,791
There were no knives in it.

2003
02:24:03,958 --> 02:24:05,583
None of our men either.

2004
02:24:06,416 --> 02:24:10,666
<i>When a bunch of boys were</i>

2005
02:24:10,750 --> 02:24:15,083
<i>Drowning in the flood</i>

2006
02:24:15,416 --> 02:24:19,791
<i>He swam against the stream</i>

2007
02:24:19,875 --> 02:24:23,958
<i>And pulled them ashore</i>

2008
02:24:33,750 --> 02:24:41,708
<i>He will show up wherever you dare him to</i>
<i>be</i>

2009
02:24:42,250 --> 02:24:50,166
<i>He will make sure you</i>
<i>Don't return in one piece</i>

2010
02:25:00,458 --> 02:25:01,666
What about your brother-in-law?

2011
02:25:09,875 --> 02:25:17,833
<i>Even if it's a hundred-pound fish...</i>

2012
02:25:18,208 --> 02:25:22,541
<i>He will drag it to the</i>

2013
02:25:22,625 --> 02:25:27,500
<i>Shore single-handedly</i>

2014
02:25:27,666 --> 02:25:35,541
<i>His glance speaks volumes of his valor</i>

2015
02:25:35,875 --> 02:25:40,125
<i>He makes the ground beneath you</i>
<i>Tremble with fear</i>

2016
02:26:29,208 --> 02:26:33,416
<i>He's a miracle worker</i>

2017
02:26:33,541 --> 02:26:37,541
<i>A man of wonders from the North</i>

2018
02:26:38,041 --> 02:26:42,291
<i>He poked me with his mischievous gaze</i>

2019
02:26:52,708 --> 02:26:56,833
<i>When he makes her feel safe</i>

2020
02:26:56,916 --> 02:27:01,208
<i>From a bunch of rogues</i>

2021
02:27:01,375 --> 02:27:08,958
<i>You can see a sparkle in her eyes</i>

2022
02:27:22,541 --> 02:27:24,625
It's okay.
I’ll take you to the hospital.

2023
02:27:42,500 --> 02:27:44,083
When you had the
intention to go…

2024
02:27:44,166 --> 02:27:47,541
why’d you tell your father
you had nothing to do with us?

2025
02:27:48,916 --> 02:27:50,000
Only during war…

2026
02:27:50,333 --> 02:27:53,708
everyone in the country unites despite
their religion, caste and region.

2027
02:27:54,333 --> 02:27:55,416
Similarly,
only during tough times…

2028
02:27:55,541 --> 02:27:57,458
everyone in the
family comes together.

2029
02:27:57,541 --> 02:27:59,250
Despite their selfishness,
hatred and revenge.

2030
02:28:00,416 --> 02:28:03,958
That is why I left this
family during a tough time.

2031
02:28:07,041 --> 02:28:09,625
If he asked why they should sacrifice
their wealth for her nephew…

2032
02:28:11,416 --> 02:28:14,083
or if she said it’s her wealth
and that he is compelled to sign.

2033
02:28:14,250 --> 02:28:15,625
These papers wouldn’t
have been signed.

2034
02:28:16,125 --> 02:28:18,500
They signed them because
they agreed on something.

2035
02:28:19,708 --> 02:28:22,250
After knowing, he gave up half
of his company for his daughter?

2036
02:28:22,833 --> 02:28:24,708
How can Kasiram hate
his brother-in-law?

2037
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,333
You wanted to see Raj get
furious and die a happy man.

2038
02:28:33,083 --> 02:28:35,000
I made it happen and you
didn’t have to die either.

2039
02:28:40,541 --> 02:28:45,458
It was hard for me to say I
have nothing to do with this family.

2040
02:28:47,291 --> 02:28:50,166
But it was more important
for you guys to be a family.

2041
02:28:54,041 --> 02:28:55,916
My King is happy
just like I hoped.

2042
02:28:56,166 --> 02:28:58,041
You can continue to visit
your Prince every day.

2043
02:29:00,916 --> 02:29:02,125
Shall we go?

2044
02:29:03,250 --> 02:29:04,166
Let's go.

2045
02:29:06,875 --> 02:29:09,583
Do you have anything else to
say, Valmiki?

2046
02:29:10,916 --> 02:29:11,875
Nothing much, sir.

2047
02:29:11,958 --> 02:29:14,291
If my son said
anything to hurt you…

2048
02:29:14,875 --> 02:29:16,916
kindly forgive him. That’s it.

2049
02:29:19,583 --> 02:29:20,416
That’s it?

2050
02:29:20,708 --> 02:29:21,541
That’s it, sir.

2051
02:29:21,833 --> 02:29:22,666
That’s it?

2052
02:29:32,833 --> 02:29:33,916
What?

2053
02:29:34,125 --> 02:29:35,250
That’s it, Valmiki?

2054
02:29:35,708 --> 02:29:36,916
That’s it?

2055
02:29:39,291 --> 02:29:40,625
He’s my grandson.

2056
02:29:42,166 --> 02:29:43,333
My blood.

2057
02:29:44,875 --> 02:29:45,958
My heir.

2058
02:29:47,166 --> 02:29:48,375
Can you hear me?

2059
02:29:48,666 --> 02:29:51,208
How can you take him
away and say that’s it?

2060
02:29:51,541 --> 02:29:56,666
I heard the nurse talk
to him in the hospital.

2061
02:30:20,416 --> 02:30:21,875
Son-in-law, he’s your son.

2062
02:30:22,250 --> 02:30:23,708
The heir to my fortune.

2063
02:30:34,583 --> 02:30:36,416
I provoked the doctor
because I knew the truth.

2064
02:30:37,083 --> 02:30:38,625
I let him into the house.

2065
02:30:40,583 --> 02:30:43,125
This house, wealth,
his mother and father…

2066
02:30:43,500 --> 02:30:47,875
I was wondering if he’d say
the truth to claim any of it.

2067
02:30:48,333 --> 02:30:49,500
But he didn’t.

2068
02:30:54,958 --> 02:30:58,333
My blood’s boiling ever since
I found out what he’s done.

2069
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:01,833
How come you’re not furious?

2070
02:31:03,250 --> 02:31:04,583
No reason to be, sir.

2071
02:31:05,333 --> 02:31:07,083
God has punished him already.

2072
02:31:08,416 --> 02:31:10,541
The cramp in his leg
soon turned into a limp.

2073
02:31:11,666 --> 02:31:13,833
The joy of exchanging kids
soon turned into fear.

2074
02:31:14,750 --> 02:31:16,750
He hasn’t had a peaceful
night in the past 25 years.

2075
02:31:18,125 --> 02:31:19,083
Let him go, sir.

2076
02:31:19,958 --> 02:31:21,833
You’re not angry with any of us.

2077
02:31:22,541 --> 02:31:24,208
You’re not greedy
for this wealth.

2078
02:31:26,416 --> 02:31:28,041
Why did you come
to this house then?

2079
02:31:30,541 --> 02:31:32,916
It’s not only the parents that
wish for their kids’ happiness.

2080
02:31:35,208 --> 02:31:37,208
Kids wish for their
parents’ happiness as well.

2081
02:31:38,833 --> 02:31:41,375
When I found out they were my
parents after 25 long years…

2082
02:31:42,125 --> 02:31:44,375
when I realized they were
going through tough times…

2083
02:31:45,125 --> 02:31:47,583
how can I just stand
there and do nothing?

2084
02:31:49,375 --> 02:31:50,666
I would never do that, sir.

2085
02:31:51,708 --> 02:31:53,458
Everyone who cursed my
dad behind his back…

2086
02:31:53,541 --> 02:31:55,166
should touch his feet
when everyone is watching.

2087
02:31:55,666 --> 02:31:57,875
My mom should be his
best friend in the world.

2088
02:31:58,500 --> 02:32:01,250
He shouldn’t blame himself
for failing his son.

2089
02:32:01,750 --> 02:32:05,416
Ramachandra is an
epitome of success.

2090
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,541
He can never lose
and I won’t let him.

2091
02:32:08,958 --> 02:32:10,625
That is why I came back
and did what I had to.

2092
02:32:11,541 --> 02:32:13,208
I don’t need anything
more than this, sir.

2093
02:32:33,500 --> 02:32:34,833
Didn’t I tell you,
father-in-law?

2094
02:32:36,708 --> 02:32:37,666
Didn’t I?

2095
02:32:39,958 --> 02:32:42,666
Didn’t I tell you
how my son would be?

2096
02:32:46,166 --> 02:32:47,583
He would be just like him.

2097
02:32:48,958 --> 02:32:50,375
Just like him!

2098
02:32:52,583 --> 02:32:53,791
Just like him.

2099
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:56,041
Just like him!

2100
02:33:03,125 --> 02:33:05,458
Sir, calm down.

2101
02:33:12,791 --> 02:33:14,000
Calm down.

2102
02:33:17,750 --> 02:33:18,875
Calm down, Dad.

2103
02:33:38,458 --> 02:33:39,291
Once…

2104
02:33:40,500 --> 02:33:42,000
Once more.

2105
02:33:42,166 --> 02:33:43,416
Please calm down, father.

2106
02:34:02,375 --> 02:34:03,208
Come.

2107
02:34:03,375 --> 02:34:05,041
Let’s meet Yasu.

2108
02:34:06,375 --> 02:34:08,666
Father-in-law,
we should tell her the truth.

2109
02:34:09,625 --> 02:34:10,958
We should tell her right away.

2110
02:34:11,625 --> 02:34:14,666
She will be happy.

2111
02:34:14,750 --> 02:34:16,416
-Come!
-No, sir.

2112
02:34:17,250 --> 02:34:18,416
No… listen to me.

2113
02:34:20,708 --> 02:34:25,958
25 years ago, he made the mistake of
taking two kids away from their mothers.

2114
02:34:27,750 --> 02:34:29,625
After nurturing
Raj for 25 years...

2115
02:34:29,958 --> 02:34:33,416
you can’t take him away from
her and make the same mistake.

2116
02:34:34,291 --> 02:34:35,500
No, sir.

2117
02:34:36,666 --> 02:34:38,250
Let’s not correct this mistake.

2118
02:34:39,250 --> 02:34:40,666
Let’s leave it here.

2119
02:34:41,458 --> 02:34:43,458
God will look after the rest.

2120
02:35:18,583 --> 02:35:20,375
You are the truth
that I don't like.

2121
02:35:23,250 --> 02:35:25,250
Because you are
better than my son.

2122
02:35:26,875 --> 02:35:28,958
I can't leave you...

2123
02:35:32,541 --> 02:35:34,541
but today you saved him.

2124
02:35:36,250 --> 02:35:38,875
Everything went well.

2125
02:35:41,666 --> 02:35:43,583
Otherwise,
I would have lost him.

2126
02:35:48,041 --> 02:35:52,375
Women accept complete
strangers as their husbands.

2127
02:35:54,291 --> 02:35:56,541
But they don’t accept a son
they haven’t given birth to.

2128
02:35:59,500 --> 02:36:02,833
I considered you my son the moment
you went there in his place.

2129
02:36:06,291 --> 02:36:08,041
Do I still have to accept you?

2130
02:36:34,375 --> 02:36:37,208
I can never repay you for
everything you have done.

2131
02:36:41,791 --> 02:36:44,000
I’m returning what you
just brought to us.

2132
02:36:45,750 --> 02:36:46,833
Take it.

2133
02:36:47,416 --> 02:36:49,208
I didn’t do it expecting
something in return, ma’am.

2134
02:36:49,958 --> 02:36:51,041
Please don't do this.

2135
02:36:54,291 --> 02:36:55,416
Take it.

2136
02:36:59,458 --> 02:37:02,375
A son should accept everything
his mother gives him.

2137
02:37:05,166 --> 02:37:07,583
-Did I do the right thing, Dad?
-Yes, dear.

2138
02:37:08,541 --> 02:37:10,166
Whatever you do is
the right thing.

2139
02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:17,541
Did anyone ever ridicule Ramu
for staying with his in-laws?

2140
02:37:18,625 --> 02:37:19,666
Do you know why?

2141
02:37:21,416 --> 02:37:24,000
Because your grandpa
requested him to come home.

2142
02:37:25,416 --> 02:37:27,875
Similarly, no one should
call you Ramachandra’s son.

2143
02:37:28,500 --> 02:37:29,416
Father…

2144
02:37:29,625 --> 02:37:30,541
Yasu…

2145
02:37:31,208 --> 02:37:34,583
I take back what I said the other day.
That he was born a Prince.

2146
02:37:35,958 --> 02:37:37,500
Let him climb his
way up to the top.

2147
02:37:38,500 --> 02:37:40,500
Get him a job and
a place to stay.

2148
02:37:42,916 --> 02:37:44,541
Why do you look dull, Valmiki?

2149
02:37:44,958 --> 02:37:46,416
Aren't half of the assets
enough for your son?

2150
02:37:46,666 --> 02:37:48,000
Shall I give him everything?

2151
02:37:49,666 --> 02:37:52,750
Train Raj in the same
way as you trained Bantu.

2152
02:37:53,333 --> 02:37:55,125
He should become the
CEO in five years.

2153
02:38:00,166 --> 02:38:01,125
Do you like it?

2154
02:38:04,833 --> 02:38:05,916
We got it, bro.

2155
02:38:08,750 --> 02:38:10,083
What are they doing here?

2156
02:38:10,791 --> 02:38:12,750
Bantu introduced us.

2157
02:38:13,666 --> 02:38:15,625
So, he rubbed his
bad luck onto you.

2158
02:38:16,500 --> 02:38:17,666
What is that?

2159
02:38:17,750 --> 02:38:18,625
It belongs to brother.

2160
02:38:19,458 --> 02:38:21,208
I have a place assigned to me
by the company, uncle.

2161
02:38:21,333 --> 02:38:23,166
And we got our stuff as well.

2162
02:38:23,958 --> 02:38:26,916
Dear, you belong to the palace.

2163
02:38:27,375 --> 02:38:28,666
It hurts me to see you here.

2164
02:38:29,083 --> 02:38:33,875
Work hard for five to six
months and prove your worth.

2165
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:37,583
You should become the next CEO.

2166
02:38:37,833 --> 02:38:39,791
You should go back
to that house.

2167
02:38:40,125 --> 02:38:41,541
What are you talking
about, uncle?

2168
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
I’m just beginning to relax.

2169
02:38:44,416 --> 02:38:46,333
Auntie made me an omelet.

2170
02:38:46,625 --> 02:38:49,875
I’m drinking and smoking without
having to worry about it.

2171
02:38:50,916 --> 02:38:54,583
And this atmosphere...
feels just like home.

2172
02:38:56,875 --> 02:38:59,500
Dear, I can’t catch up.

2173
02:39:00,083 --> 02:39:02,041
Can you repeat it
with better grammar?

2174
02:39:03,041 --> 02:39:05,625
That is why I wrote this down.

2175
02:39:07,041 --> 02:39:09,500
25 years ago, when we were born…

2176
02:39:10,083 --> 02:39:11,833
we wouldn’t have had
a problem with this crime.

2177
02:39:12,500 --> 02:39:19,208
You should've put me in auntie’s
ward and Bantu in my mom’s ward.

2178
02:39:19,791 --> 02:39:21,000
It would’ve been perfect.

2179
02:39:26,083 --> 02:39:27,250
It’s a sin, dear.

2180
02:39:28,125 --> 02:39:29,875
We can’t take peoples'
fate into our hands.

2181
02:39:31,541 --> 02:39:33,208
It wouldn't have worked out.

2182
02:39:33,916 --> 02:39:35,625
Tear that paper.

2183
02:39:41,625 --> 02:39:43,541
Sir! What are you doing here?

2184
02:39:44,125 --> 02:39:47,333
Someone stabbed Appala Naidu
and thrashed his son.

2185
02:39:47,500 --> 02:39:50,416
So, they got scared and
withdrew all their cases.

2186
02:39:50,583 --> 02:39:53,125
I wanted to give the
good news to Mr. ARK.

2187
02:39:53,208 --> 02:39:54,916
I’m the one who stabbed
and thrashed his son, sir.

2188
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:55,916
Hey! Hey!

2189
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,541
Don’t claim that you’ve stabbed
everyone in the world.

2190
02:39:58,708 --> 02:40:00,041
Give some credit to
the other criminals.

2191
02:40:00,125 --> 02:40:01,708
I'm telling the truth, sir.

2192
02:40:02,833 --> 02:40:04,791
What do you do for a living?

2193
02:40:05,458 --> 02:40:06,500
God, I hate this.

2194
02:40:06,708 --> 02:40:08,750
No one believes me
unless I wear this.

2195
02:40:11,625 --> 02:40:12,875
Show me your card.

2196
02:40:14,916 --> 02:40:16,458
Hold it carefully.

2197
02:40:17,041 --> 02:40:19,458
No matter how critical
the emergency is…

2198
02:40:19,791 --> 02:40:21,875
I swear I will never
visit your hospital.

2199
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:23,583
Sir… my card.

2200
02:40:23,750 --> 02:40:26,041
You’ve given the helicopter
to my son-in-law anyway.

2201
02:40:26,166 --> 02:40:30,250
It would be great if you
give me your old Rolls Royce.

2202
02:40:30,416 --> 02:40:34,125
Don’t return the petrol bill to
them, please.

2203
02:40:43,833 --> 02:40:45,375
Why are you crying?

2204
02:40:47,541 --> 02:40:50,958
I didn’t know it’s so hard
to see your dreams come true.

2205
02:40:51,416 --> 02:40:53,333
Are you talking about him?
Then you’re right.

2206
02:40:53,791 --> 02:40:56,750
They give him a suit to wear.
A girl to marry.

2207
02:40:56,958 --> 02:40:59,500
And a helicopter to fly in.

2208
02:40:59,708 --> 02:41:04,458
How can they be so happy after handing
over such a huge company to him?

2209
02:41:07,666 --> 02:41:11,041
I’ve been blabbering.
Don’t you have something to say?

2210
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:13,958
Well... I was forced to do this.

2211
02:41:15,166 --> 02:41:16,583
Give me my card, sir.
I’ll leave.

2212
02:41:16,791 --> 02:41:18,291
Wait... go!

2213
02:41:18,750 --> 02:41:23,708
I just realized why we all
need a break.

2214
02:41:25,250 --> 02:41:26,291
Finally!
